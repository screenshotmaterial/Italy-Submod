### Ideas ###
 KDR_Religious_Fevour: "Religious Fervour"
 KDR_Religious_Fevour_desc: "Allahu Akbar! The heretic government in Kostantiniyye has proven that it cares little for the Islamic unity promoted by the office of the Caliph. It is now up to us, religious orders, tribesmen and devout followers of the Kurdish Sheikhs to take up arms and oust the traitors from their cushy seats in the capital."
 KDR_Irregular_Army: "Hamidiye Army"
 KDR_Irregular_Army_desc: "Based around the disbanded 'Hamidiye' regiments of the late Abdulhamid II, the Kurdish army suffers from an almost complete lack of discipline and unity as it relies far too much on a decentralised force led by Sheikhs and Aghas. Equipped with mostly pre-weltkrieg weapons, they furthermore suffer a serious material disadvantage compared to the much better equipped Turks."

### Events ###
 kur.1.t: "A Fragile Rebellion"
 kur.1.d: "When the Sheikhs and Aghas planted their banners in the ground before the Diyarbakır Ulu Camii (Great Mosque of Diyarbakır), many doubted their capabilities to wage an effective war on the regime of the Kemalists. Nonetheless many also doubted that these forces would ever combine their arms in the first place.\n\nWith railroads encroaching on the Kurdish domain, with Faith losing the status it deserves by the day and with Turkish intellectuals attempting to force their vision on our Grand Caliphate, many have seen the Light. Letters of support are coming in from all across the Muslim world, and volunteers willing to fight for the Caliph are signing up in Diyarbakir. The cursed infidels of the capital will very soon be shown the error of their ways, and the streets will run red with the blood of those opposing us! So let us go, restore the honour of our Caliph and save all Islam from this catastrophe!"
 kur.1.a: "Allahu Akbar!"

 kur.2.t: "Sulaymaniyah declares its independence"
 kur.2.d: "Declared by the recently-returned Sheikh Mahmut Barzinji, the city of Sulaymaniyah and the surrounding territory has decided to break with the Ottoman Empire and use the ruling chaos in the Mashriq to carve out a state of their own. This decision comes a bit as a surprise for his former ally in [PER.GetName], who intended for him to destabilise the Porte but not declare a Kurdish state. Fearing support from their own Kurdish population for his cause, it remains currently unclear whether Iran will turn their guns on him before the situation could further deteriorate."
 kur.2.a: "Damn Barzinji!"
