 PLC_poland_first_desc: "The new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth needs a new capital. Warsaw is the obvious choice, being the historic centre of the old Commonwealth and the largest city in the nation."
 PLC_striking_the_balance_desc: "The new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth needs a new capital. As choosing either Warsaw or Vilnius as the seat of power would greatly upset half of the nation, perhaps it is a better idea to choose an entirely new city to be the seat of power in the new nation. A symbolic rebirth for all the people of the Commonwealth."
 PLC_lithuania_first_desc: "The new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth needs a new capital. Vilnius is the obvious choice, being the seat of Vytautas II and the accepted capital of the nation in the Reichspakt."
 PLC_the_new_bureaucracy_desc: "The bureaucracy of the Commonwealth is struggling to cope with the gargantuan task of integrating the governments of two wholly separate nations. We must put every effort into resolving the issues they face and integrating our two governments as quickly as possible."
 PLC_solve_racial_tensions_desc: "Despite our best efforts to the contrary, in the uncertainty of our new nation's birth, a mistrust has formed between the Polish and Lithuanian peoples. We must resolve this at once if we are to move forward as one unified state."
 PLC_a_unifying_faith_desc: "The Warsaw Confederation, signed in 1573, was a document that pledged mutual support and tolerance between all religious groups in the union. Re-drafting this historic confederation will have great value both practically and symbolically. Even if we cannot all come together in the politics of our nation, we can find common ground in faith. It is not the end of our troubles, but it is a start."
 PLC_a_new_capital_desc: "The new capital contains almost none of the required infrastructure to contain the proper capital of a nation-state. We must rectify this immediately if we are to run the government from this new location."
 PLC_expand_vilnius_desc: "Vilnius is as it stands a small city compared to the great seats of power across the globe. We must rebuild the lost Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, destroyed in 1801, so that it can stand proud among the other capitals of Europe."
 PLC_build_warsaw_palace_desc: "The seat of J.K.D. Vytautas II, the Royal Castle at Warsaw stands as a representation of our power and opulence. By expanding and improving the Castle, we signal that the new Commonwealth is a nation with the wealth and power to stand among the great powers of our time."
 PLC_sejm_dominance_desc: "With the Commonwealth's Sejm based in Warsaw, the Polish have an extensive home-field advantage when the governmental body meets. Exploiting this dominance will allow us to push through every political measure we deem necessary, and reduce the chance of Polish-Lithuanian bipartisanship from grinding our government to a halt."
 PLC_mendog_iii_desc: "Vytautas II of Urach is a symbol of unity and peace that is admired not only inside the nation, but outside it as well. The King as he stands is a powerful symbol for unity, but with a little effort from our Ministry of Propaganda, he could become an almost legendary figure, inspiring our people and soldiers to work harder than ever before."
 PLC_lithuanian_lead_desc: "With Vilnius as the capital of the new Commonwealth, and Vytautas II on the throne, it is time for the Lithuanian people to leverage these advantages and take charge of the nation, and to be the leading force in Commonwealth politics."
 PLC_polish_language_desc: "The population disparity between the Polish and Lithuanians is something we can and will exploit. If a vast majority of the citizens in the nation wish to pass laws which happen to favour the Polish over the Lithuanians, who are we to say no? It is what the majority demands."
 PLC_minority_rights_desc: "It is not only Polish and Lithuanians who live inside the borders of the Commonwealth, lest we forget. These people, too, are scared of their place inside the new nation, and it is only by including all of the peoples living under our banner that the rifts between us can be mended."
 PLC_decentralization_desc: "The initiative to select the Prime Minster of the nation was only the beginning. The people are clamouring for more control over the inner workings of the government, and with how successful the last elections were, it appears that we are taking our first steps towards a more democratic state."
 PLC_centralizing_power_desc: "The people of the Commonwealth do not know what their best interests are. Only the upper crust of society can be entrusted to make the important decisions in government."
 PLC_building_the_capital_desc: "The capital still requires more construction to be truly great. A new construction initiative will bring many of the capital's services up to the high standard people would expect from a world-class capital city."
 PLC_vilnius_warsaw_railway_desc: "The new capital has brought to light how difficult it is to actually travel around the Commonwealth. A new railway connecting the nation's two largest cities would greatly increase the people's ability to travel around the nation."
 PLC_an_absolute_monarch_desc: "The collapse of democratic nations around the world has taught us a valuable lesson: rule of the people is a concept doomed to failure. The King's word shall be the final authority on all matters of state."
 PLC_a_smaller_circle_desc: "For far too long far too many have had the ear of the king. It is time we cull those with power down to a select few. The more people who have power, the more who will undo the nation to gain more of it."
 PLC_local_representatives_desc: "'The King reigns but does not govern.' It is time to allow the people living in the different parts of the nation to elect their own local representatives to the Sejm, rather than them being appointed from influential members of society. This will increase both our ability to sate the needs of different regions, and include the people more in our political structure."
 PLC_complete_suffrage_desc: "The right to vote has long been fought over in other nations around the world, but we have to come to our own conclusion. All who are true citizens of the Commonwealth shall be allowed to vote, as a universal right."
 PLC_redefining_territories_desc: "One of the problems the bureaucracy faces is the different administrative divisions used by Poland and Lithuania. We must create an entirely new system for defining these territories, so that we may tax and govern them equally."
 PLC_a_common_currency_desc: "Combining two economic systems was never going to be easy, but our new plan to move both nations onto a new economic standard will form the backbone of our economy for years to come."
 PLC_a_combined_constitution_desc: "The Great Sejm of 1788 was called shortly before the end of the first Commonwealth with the goal of radically reforming the constitution of the nation and fixing political decay. They were successful, and it is time we emulate their success by calling a new Great Sejm to draft another constitution. A new constitution will go a long way to marking the end of the uncertainty surrounding our nation's birth."
 PLC_mitteleuropa_question_desc: "Lithuania was member of the Reichspakt Alliance. Poland was not. With the combination of our two countries as one, the question remains on whether or not the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth will remain in the alliance or attempt to weasel their way out from under Germany's shadow."
 PLC_the_revolution_desc: "The flames of the Syndicalist revolution burn bright! The monarchy has been overthrown, the bourgeoisie toppled, and the future seized in the hands of the people! It is time for all men and women to join hands for the Syndicalist cause!"
 PLC_new_secret_police_desc: "Even with all true citizens of the Polish-Lithuanian Commune being loyal to the Syndicalist cause, there are still rats who wish nothing more than to see the common man suffering under the weight of the nobility's oppression. The new Ministry of Public Security will see to these insurrectionists."
 PLC_join_with_france_desc: "Long the symbol of Syndicalism worldwide, the French Commune would certainly welcome us with open arms if we were to declare interest in joining the Internationale. It is high time we join arms with France, before our enemies move against us."
 PLC_mobilize_the_people_desc: "The revolution shall not be won by lying on our backsides! The people must rise up and seize victory themselves! All true citizens of the Commune are called to arms to defend the state from the vile nations who seek our downfall."
 PLC_diplomatic_offices_desc: "The Commonwealth now stands alone in a sea of shifting alliances. We must expand our diplomatic reach with new diplomatic initiatives around the globe."
 PLC_the_monarch_desc: "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is a new nation, and the old commitments of her member states no longer bind her. We do not need Germany to dictate our policies for us, we can stand mighty even if we must do so alone."
 PLC_stick_with_germany_desc: "The German Empire represents the best opportunity for our nation to grow and prosper. We are too weak right now to attempt to strike out on our own, even if we must suffer Germany's hubris for a few more years."
 PLC_economic_treaties_desc: "The Reichspakt Alliance offers far more beyond simple military defence. The Alliance also allows for one's inclusion into Germany's economic sphere, and by joining, our economy will undoubtedly receive a healthy boost."
 PLC_german_advisors_desc: "Reforming our military and political structure is of the utmost importance if we are to remain politically relevant in Europe. By taking advantage of our German alliance, we can allow them to send us advisors to modernise our armed forces."
 PLC_our_natural_borders_desc: "Even with Poland and Lithuania joining in union, the amount of territory we control pales to the territory held at the height of the old Commonwealth. The Partitions of Poland were a crime against our people, and we must reclaim the lands unjustly stolen from us. As it appears that our neighbours will not merely allow us to take their land, we shall seize it by force."
 PLC_the_greater_commonwealth_desc: "It is not through aggressive military action, but rather shrewd diplomacy that will allow us to grow and prosper. We shall adopt a policy of peaceful expansionism, where the pen is mightier than the sword."
 PLC_ruthenian_invitation_desc: "The drastic upswing in Polish and Lithuanian nationalism has had an effect even outside of our borders. In Ukraine, a small but vocal minority has been causing problems for the local authorities in provinces along our mutual border. These voices, while still very small, could prove the political chess piece we need to instigate a border revision with Ukraine."
 PLC_galician_referendum_desc: "The Austrian subject of Galicia and Lodomeria has long been a thorn in Poland's side, a pretender state that often claimed portions of rightful Polish territory. Now, it seems that Galicia may have become a thorn in Austria's side as well. Rumours have spread that Austria may be amenable to a deal with us over Galicia, a deal that will mutually benefit us both."
 PLC_german_territories_desc: "After the end of the first Weltkrieg, Poland and Lithuania both were promised territories that we were not given in full. Germany still holds on to vital territories with ethnic Poles and Lithuanians clamouring to join our union. It is becoming a problem for Germany, and one that we could be able to help with..."
 PLC_strike_east_desc: "The political turmoil in Russia has made for a violent and unpredictable neighbour. It is only a matter of time before the vile expansionist Russian state turns its eyes upon us. We must strike first before they have the opportunity, and finally avenge the destruction of the Commonwealth."
 PLC_strike_south_desc: "The Austrian Empire is a shell of its former self, with internal strife bringing the massive empire to its knees. We must strike now while the Austrians are weak, and seize the territories that are rightfully ours."
 PLC_strike_north_desc: "Since our parting with the Reichspakt, tensions between the large alliance and ourselves have been high. The Reichspakt nations are now very unlikely to give in to any territorial demands we make of them. This leaves only one option to recover our rightful territory."
 PLC_mobile_army_desc: "An immobile army is nothing more than a large target. Only by keeping our forces in constant motion can we be unpredictable to our enemies and strike where they least expect it."
 PLC_impenetrable_defense_desc: "Poland-Lithuania's strength is not in its offensive capability, but in its ability to withstand any blow. Victory is not obtained by some fantastical "killing blow" but rather by destroying the enemy's will to advance."
 PLC_integrating_two_armies_desc: "Rather than giving one side or the other the leadership position to rebuild the new army, we should attempt to take the best ideas from both sides, and form a new army from combination of these two forces. It will be harder at first, but it will pay off in the long run."
 PLC_polish_leadership_desc: "Placing the Polish military in a leadership position when forming the new army will ensure that their offensive tactics pervade the new army in its formation."
 PLC_lithuanian_tactics_desc: "The Lithuanian school of military thought is focused on a solid defence, rather than strong offensive manoeuvres. Giving the Lithuanians leadership in forming the new army will ensure these military ideas pervade the new Commonwealth's army."
 PLC_special_forces_desc: "A strong offensive force relies not only on the main army, but also the precisely trained units that can perform in extreme conditions. We are currently in need of these types of units. It is time to start training."
 PLC_mobile_infantry_desc: "Foot soldiers have had their day. Mobile infantry with motorised vehicles are the infantry units of the future, and the sooner we modernise our armed forces to this standard, the sooner we will see great success on the battlefield."
 PLC_supply_chains_desc: "An army marches on its stomach, and when making large offensive pushes, our success or failure will hinge on our ability to get supplies to our men. By spending a large amount of effort modernising and improving our supply chain structure, we can ensure our troops stay well supplied."
 PLC_armored_spearhead_desc: "The crux of our offensive capability, armoured units allow us to strike whenever and wherever we want. This spearheads into our enemy's heartland are critical to our doctrine, and we must spend every effort to improve our models so that they remain competitive on the battlefield."
 PLC_tank_innovations_desc: "The first Panzers of the Commonwealth were those from the Polish and Lithuanian military's, old dilapidated models from the Weltkrieg. Even now the models we use are heavily based on German Panzer designs. It is time to take the first steps to creating the first truly unique Polish-Lithuanian Panzer."
 PLC_killing_blow_desc: "It is not enough to be an army to be mobile. We must also be swift, and able to mount a strong offensive at a moment's notice. This ability to strike a definitive killing blow will make our forces unstoppable on the battlefield."
 PLC_never_surrender_desc: "Even after the state has fallen, it is the duty of every citizen to carry on the fight. We must fight in the shadows and in the gutters, letting our enemies know that the war will not end until every last citizen has laid down their lives in defence of the state."
 PLC_trench_warfare_desc: "Some say the age of the trench is over. We say it is only beginning. Creating a vast defensive trench network on the front lines will ensure our troops are well defended even in the most heated battles."
 PLC_artillery_focus_desc: "Even with the Weltkrieg long over, the artillery doctrines from that war are still effective. Bringing a large artillery force to every engagement will ensure the skies are filled with our shells."
 PLC_moving_fortresses_desc: "Panzers are not only for precision strikes. By instead focusing on large, lumbering tanks that can take a beating, we can instead create mobile fortresses that can move and secure positions around the battlefield."
 PLC_russian_forts_desc: "Engineers are vital in maintaining our defensive fortifications and destroying the enemy's. We should expand and improve our army engineering units."
 PLC_holding_our_gains_desc: "Our cities are large, expansive fortifications waiting to be exploited. Constructing large arsenals and other city-wide fortifications will make every effort to take our cities an expensive endear. Our foes will pay for every inch of our territory in blood."
 PLC_mobilization_desc: "With the tides of European politics being what they are, it is only a matter of time before conflict sweeps the continent. We must mobilise our army before conflict breaks out so that we are not caught unaware when conflict breaks out."
 PLC_wartime_rations_desc: "Our resources are critical to the war effort, and every citizen has an obligation to ration so that the army may have all it requires. The sacrifice made by the people now will be rewarded when our armies are victorious in the battlefield."
 PLC_new_tactics_desc: "The strategies and tactics used in the last war will not survive the first month of the next war. We must expend our effort in ensuring that our army is not left fighting the last war."
 PLC_army_drills_desc: "A regular series of drills and exercises while training our soldiers will ensure that our troops are as prepared as they can be for the coming wars."
 PLC_reforming_high_command_desc: "The High Command of the Poland-Lithuania has been a patchwork combination of officers from both the Polish and Lithuanian military's. It is time we dissolve the old ineffectual High Command in favour of finally creating a unified command structure, with all old officers properly integrated into the new hierarchy."
 PLC_army_designs_desc: "Creating a specific military branch for the design and testing of new equipment will ensure that good designs are put into the hands of our soldiers in a timely and efficient manner."
 PLC_polish_structure_desc: "Poland represents the economic centre of our nation, and it is in our best interest to further expand the existing infrastructure there. This will centralise our infrastructure in a single location and encourage economic growth in the region."
 PLC_lithuanian_structure_desc: "Less populous and with less industry, Lithuania is far more in need of governmental assistance than Poland. By focusing our economic growth on the less industrial regions in Lithuania, we can ensure that the entire country is brought up to the same standard."
 PLC_polish_monopolies_desc: "Although it may create economic problems in the long term, there are many Polish corporations chomping at the bit to move into Lithuania with their economic products. Local Lithuanian companies may be adversely affected, but the existing Polish corporations are predicting massive profits, which will surely also come to us."
 PLC_polish_farms_desc: "The disparity between Polish urban and industrial centres versus the rural areas is immense. Some regions in Poland are still farming with tools little different from tools used in the Middle Ages, and this lack of technological advancement is holding us back. Spending time to give these farmers the tools they need to enter the modern age will pay large dividends."
 PLC_steel_factories_desc: "Expanding Polish steel production by subsidising enterprises like the Scheibler and Grohman Works will ensure that there is an ample steel supply to feed to our arms and munitions factories come a time of war."
 PLC_tungsten_mining_desc: "The Baltic oil shelf is simply waiting to be exploited for the oil reserves being held within. We must subsidise the exploitation of these reserves so that our military forces can exploit these reserves to fuel our war effort."
 PLC_urban_districts_desc: "Our cities are disorganised and chaotic. Reorganising our urban zoning laws to better support industrial efforts will increase our productivity nation-wide."
 PLC_lithuanian_corporations_desc: "With the recent discovery of oil in Lithuania, many corporations have sprung up in an attempt to control the flow of oil. Subsidising these enterprises will allow these corporations to provide us with more oil, and faster than before."
 PLC_reform_economy_desc: "The Black Monday disaster has severely hurt our nation's economy. The only way out of this disaster is to introduce emergency economic measures, which we hope will place our economy on the road to recovery."
 PLC_recover_black_monday_desc: "Our original economic plan of recovery has proven moderately successful, but it has become clear that more measures are needed to fully recover the economy. By implementing these measures we hope to put the nightmare of Black Monday behind us once and for all."
 PLC_railways_desc: "Connecting our large rail networks to the nations around us will allow us to more effectively allow trade between ourselves. These networks will greatly increase the strength of our industry and fuel our economy."
 PLC_more_railways_desc: "The rail gauges in both Poland and Lithuania are often created to different measurements. Conforming these gauges to a single unified standard will allow train cars to travel across the nation unhindered, and increase the mobility of men and materials across the nation."
 PLC_military_factories_desc: "Our military buildup will be all for nought if our men have to rifles to arm themselves with. Our military relies on our industrial capacity to produce arms and ammunition. Investing in these military factories will allow us to create an army that can handle any situation."
 PLC_combined_infrastructure_desc: "Combining and integrating the vastly different infrastructures in Poland and Lithuania is an immense task, but when successful, will allow our industry to take full advantage of the resources of both nations."
 PLC_new_economy_desc: "With a new age comes a new economy. The people of Poland-Lithuania are coming to realise their needs and desires in the new era. Investing in the civilian economy will ensure our citizens get what they desire, and these new factories could be put to other uses, should war break out."
 PLC_more_military_factories_desc: "War consumes, and both sides constantly struggle to outproduce the other. We must create as many factories as we can, so that we may produce enough weapons to smother our enemies in bullets."
 PLC_industrial_innovations_desc: "The industrial sector has long proved a valuable source of innovations, even in areas of military interest. Taking these privately funded products and placing them in the hands of the military could prove useful in designing new weapons with which to win the war."
 PLC_poles_in_the_navy_desc: "Giving the inexperienced but enthusiastic Poles leadership over the new navy will allow them greater influence over the formation of the new navy. The Polish have great dreams of a large and expansive fleet, and their ideals will permeate the navy at all levels."
 PLC_polish_officers_desc: "Long since separated from the sea, the Polish people have taken to the new navy with great enthusiasm. Although lacking in proper experience, their numbers have been filling our ranks quickly, and their new ideas may end up forming the foundation of the new navy."
 PLC_lithuanian_experience_desc: "Lithuanian experience will prove the deciding factor in creating the new navy. While Lithuania did not possess a particularly strong navy, their continual access to the sea for the past two decades will prove invaluable in the formation of our new navy."
 PLC_lithuanian_ships_desc: "Giving the Lithuanians control over the formation of the navy will allow them to carve their ideals into its foundation. The Lithuanian naval ideal focuses on small but flexible vessels and small engagements near the coasts."
 PLC_baltic_protection_desc: "Our interests at sea extend no farther than the Baltic. To attempt to extend our reach farther would be ludicrous. By instead focusing all of our efforts on protecting our coastline from enemy attacks. We can prevent our enemies from opening a new front on our coast."
 PLC_atlantic_fleet_desc: "It is our duty to create a fleet that will sail the open seas, and contest the waters of the Atlantic against our foes. An Atlantic fleet will be difficult to construct, but projecting our power into the seas is worth any price."
 PLC_versatile_fleet_desc: "Without the resources to create a grand armada, we must create a fleet that is capable of engaging in any situation, and is capable of adapting itself to the situation at hand."
 PLC_anti_submarines_desc: "Without a large commitment to naval warfare, one of the most damaging ways our enemies can damage us is through submarine warfare. Focusing on destroying submarines will at the very least diminish our enemy's ability to attack our convoys."
 PLC_naval_bombers_desc: "Who says we must have our own navy to contest another nation's fleet? Investing heavily into naval bombers will allow us to create a large deterrent to any navy that dares come close to our own coasts."
 PLC_coastal_forts_desc: "We must be prepared in the case that our naval defences fail. A network of coastal fortifications across our small coastline will greatly increase our ability to defend against a naval landing."
 PLC_cruiser_research_desc: "Modern cruisers have proved very effective in the past as commerce raiders by combining good mobility with great firepower. Given their potential and our need to strike at the arteries of our enemies, we should devote more resources towards maximising their effectiveness in this particular role."
 PLC_new_dockyards_desc: "The current naval infrastructure in our small Lithuanian coastline is nowhere near sufficient to support a proper navy. If we are to create a navy that can compete in open battle, we must work on drastically overhauling our naval capabilities."
 PLC_naval_infrastructure_desc: "Constructing new dockyards and other naval infrastructure is the key to constructing our future navy. A national effort focusing on naval buildup is the only way we will field a navy in any reasonable amount of time."
 PLC_naval_academy_desc: "A new navy requires new naval officers. The construction of a new naval academy will be our first steps in training the next generation of Commonwealth naval officers."
 PLC_experimental_designs_desc: "With our complete lack of a serviceable navy, it is obvious that attempting to construct a simple navy based on other nation's navies is not the way forward. We have neither the time nor the ships to waste on such efforts. Thus we must turn to unorthodox ships that can potentially turn the tide of the war."
 PLC_battleships_desc: "Every great navy has a core of strong battleships around which the rest of the fleet forms. If we are to stand among the other great powers of the world, we need to create our own battleships to form the backbone of our new fleet."
 PLC_carrier_experiments_desc: "Carriers are a recent addition to the world of naval warfare, but they seem to be performing well whenever deployed. Carriers represent a very large investment to produce, but could prove pivotal to winning supremacy on the seas."
 PLC_marine_focus_desc: "As a function of expanding our power overseas, there may come a time when we need to deploy our soldiers to fronts across the world. To this end, it is necessary to train a new generation of marines, so that any naval endeavours we undertake will be properly supported."
 PLC_submarine_tactics_desc: "Without a proper navy to contest control of the seas, one of the only remaining ways we can disrupt the operations of our enemies is to employ submarines to attack their shipping. This method of warfare is unlikely to earn us many friends, but it has proven brutally effective in past conflicts."
 PLC_trade_interdiction_desc: "With our initial foray into unrestricted submarine warfare proving promising, it is time to advance our operations out into the Atlantic. If we are able to place submarines in key positions in the Atlantic, we will be able to restrict our foe's shipping abilities with far greater efficiency than before."
 PLC_royal_air_force_desc: "Giving the Polish Royal Air Force the lead in forming the new air force of Poland-Lithuania, we will ensure that their philosophy of close-air support pervades the ideals of the new air force."
 PLC_lithuanian_air_force_desc: "Giving the Lithuanian Air Force control in forming the new air force of the nation will ensure that they are able to infuse the new air force with their traditional ideals of air superiority and strategic bombing."
 PLC_tactical_bombers_desc: "Supporting and continuing to develop tactical bombers will drastically improve our soldier's ability to deal with unexpected threats on the ground. These tactical bombers will form a powerful force when used in conjunction with our ground troops."
 PLC_cas_focus_desc: "Close Air support has proven to be critical to the success of many military operations, and developing new tactics around the effective use of CAS wings will only multiply this effectiveness."
 PLC_radar_desc: "Creating new RADAR stations in key areas will allow us to intercept enemy air forces before they are able to execute their missions. These stations may prove critical to the war effort if our opponents rely heavily on air forces."
 PLC_paratrooper_focus_desc: "With the new age of air warfare upon us, it is only natural that we should attempt to place even our infantry in the skies. The new initiative to create new paratrooper units will allow us to operate in regions where ground advance is near-impossible."
 PLC_fighters_desc: "The age of the biplane is long since gone. Much of our air force is old and decrepit, and our hangars are stocked with ancient biplanes. We must work on modernising our air force so that our planes are not rendered mere target practice for enemy pilots."
 PLC_better_fighters_desc: "With our air force no longer consisting of Weltkrieg-era biplanes, we can work on not only creating a new fighter design that can compete with other planes, but one that can surpass the fighters used in enemy formations."
 PLC_rocket_experiments_desc: "A recent scientific breakthrough has made feasible the use of jets to power more modern fighter designs. Creating a fighter that uses rocketry as its main method of transportation was merely a fantasy a few decades ago, but now it seems to be within our grasp."
 PLC_air_tactics_desc: "It is not enough to merely produce more planes. We must also update our trains of thought if our fighters are to have any successes in the skies. We must make a concerted effort to create new air combat tactics and defeat our foes before the planes even leave the runway."
 PLC_more_air_tactics_desc: "Working in concert with each other, leading minds from both air forces in Poland-Lithuania have begun working to create new doctrine centred around modern air designs. This doctrine, when completed, will form the basis of our air operations for years to come."
 PLC_heavy_fighters_desc: "The idea of the heavy fighter has proven very enticing to leading members of the new air force, and plans have been put forward to design our own models. These fighters will prove effective in combating enemy operations in our skies."
 PLC_strategic_bombers_desc: "Even when our soldiers in the field struggle, they can rest easy knowing they are fighting for their families back home. We seek to deprive the enemy of the same thoughts, by destroying their cities and homes, and drastically lowering enemy morale."

### Events ###
 plcommon.1.t: "The New Prime Minister"
 plcommon.1.d: "As the foundation of the Commonwealth is now complete, it is now time to decide who will become the Prime Minister."
 plcommon.1.a: "Janusz Radziwill, the leader of the aristocrats."
 plcommon.1.b: "Stanislaw Narutowicz, the leader of the conservatives."

 plcommon.2.t: "The Capital"
 plcommon.2.d: "With the rebirth of the Commonwealth we must decide where our capital should be. Historically the Commonwealth was based in Warsaw, an option favoured by the Poles. However the Lithuanians argue that Vilnius could also be used. The intense arguments between the Poles and Lithuanians have left us with no choice but to compromise. The idea of a new capital has gained popular support recently and has taken hold in the minds of the wider public; all that is left now is for us to pick which city shall become our capital."
 plcommon.2.a: "Lublin, the original site of the union!"
 plcommon.2.b: "Siauliai!"
 plcommon.2.c: "Białystok!"

 plcommon.4.t: "Language Question"
 plcommon.4.d: "Our policy on the official language of the Commonwealth has to be formed. While varying areas speak Polish or Lithuanian, we need to decide the working language of our government. Polish is the obvious choice, as the majority of our nation speaks it, but bilingualism would satisfy the Lithuanian minority who are afraid of Polish domination. What should we do?"
 plcommon.4.a: "The government will be bilingual!"
 plcommon.4.b: "Use only Polish for the government."

 plcommon.5.t: "Dmowski's Nationalists"
 plcommon.5.d: "Roman Dmowski, leader of Polish National-Radical Party, has recently come into the spotlight for his increasingly nationalist and pro-Polish views. His most recent populist speech on the "Lithuanian favouritism" pervading the government has gained traction among Commonwealth citizens, and Dmowski himself is quickly gaining supporters. If we continue to support Lithuanian interests in the government, this may be a sign of things to come."
 plcommon.5.a: "He's barely worth noticing."

 plcommon.6.t: "Voldemaras' Nationalists"
 plcommon.6.d: "Augustinas Voldemaras, leader of the Lithuanian nationalists, has recently come into the spotlight for his increasingly nationalist and pro-Lithuanian views. His most recent populist speech on the "Polish scourge" pervading the government has gained traction among Commonwealth citizens, and Voldemaras himself is quickly gaining supporters. If we continue to support Polish interests in the government, this may be a sign of things to come."
 plcommon.6.a: "He's barely worth noticing."

 plcommon.7.t: "National Armed Forces"
 plcommon.7.d: "Roman Dmowski said that the National-Radical Party, a paramilitary organisation created a few months ago, has to begun to fight against the 'government under Jewish and Lithuanian peasant influence, which threatens the Polish nation.' The number of his supporters is growing very fast."
 plcommon.7.a: "Smash those rebels!"

 plcommon.8.t: "Dmowski is Dead!"
 plcommon.8.d: "Dmowski, who has been a thorn in our side by setting up opposition against the Commonwealth, was killed in one of clashes between the army and his men. His death has sparked a fire of Polish nationalism, this is not going to end well."
 plcommon.8.a: "Damn it..."

 plcommon.9.t: "March of the National-Radicals"
 plcommon.9.d: "After Dmowski's death, Adam Doboszynski took leadership of the National-Radical Party and organised a march to the capital of the Commonwealth, demanding both punishment for the murderers of Dmowski and a government led by himself and his supporters. The situation is very dire, there are thousands of supporters of the National-Radical Party in the capital. There is violence in the streets of the capital as nationalist rebels attempt to seize control of key government buildings. Only our armed forces can save us now..."
 plcommon.9.a: "Doboszynski's coup was a success!"
 plcommon.9.b: "(Play as Lithuania)"

 plcommon.12.t: "Nationalists Takeover in the Commonwealth!"
 plcommon.12.d: "Today the rightful King of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania, Vytautas II, was captured by Adam Doboszynski and his Polish nationalist henchmen. Doboszynski officially withdrew the Commonwealth from the Reichspakt and declared that the Commonwealth is now free from 'German domination.' We need to respond to this crisis immediately, so what should we do?"
 plcommon.12.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
 plcommon.12.b: "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"

 plcommon.13.t: "The First Sejm Election"
 plcommon.13.d: "Excited voters from across the Commonwealth have gathered in the cities on this historic day to cast their votes in the first combined Polish-Lithuanian election in the new Commonwealth. The king's decree that the people would be allowed to vote has galvanised political movements across the nation, and many different political movements seem capable of sweeping the ballots.\n\nEven, worryingly, some Populist and Syndicalist movements, whose victory could spell disaster for the fledgling Commonwealth. Which party will come out on top?"
 plcommon.13.a: "The Patriotic Party."
 plcommon.13.b: "The People's Coalition."
 plcommon.13.c: "The National-Radical Party of Poland."
 plcommon.13.e: "The Syndicalist Party of the Commonwealth."

 plcommon.14.t: "Syndicalist Takeover in the Commonwealth!"
 plcommon.14.d: "Terrible news! A Syndicalist party has recently gained a majority during the last elections in the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania. The new Syndicalist government officially withdrew the Commonwealth from the Reichspakt and declared that the Commonwealth is now free from 'German domination.' We need to respond to this crisis immediately, so what should we do?"
 plcommon.14.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
 plcommon.14.b: "Such betrayal will not be tolerated!"

 plcommon.15.t: "The Sejm Elections"
 plcommon.15.d: "Under our constitution, elections must be held every four years. There are four main political parties that have a chance of winning at the ballot box, who will it be?"
 plcommon.15.a: "The King shall put an end to this chaos."
 plcommon.15.b: "The Patriotic Party."
 plcommon.15.c: "The Democratic Party."
 plcommon.15.e: "The People's Coalition."

 plcommon.19.t: "Status of Galicia"
 plcommon.19.d: "With the reunification process of our countries complete, we can finally intensify our efforts to reclaim vital parts of our homeland. The lands of Galicia and Lodomeria were part of our country. Now, they are under the direct control of Vienna. We can try to bring back Galicia and Lodomeria through direct negotiations with Vienna."
 plcommon.19.a: "Start talks in Vienna."
 plcommon.19.b: "We don't need that."

 plcommon.20.t: "Commonwealth Asks about Galicia"
 plcommon.20.d: "The lands of Galicia and Lodomeria were part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Now, that it has been reformed, they have claimed that region, demanding the transfer of Galicia and Lodomeria in exchange for a large amount of industrial goods, money, and a treaty of mutual protection and recognition of borders."
 plcommon.20.a: "Never! It's part of our monarchy!"
 plcommon.20.b: "Let them go."

 plcommon.23.t: "Galicia is Ours!"
 plcommon.23.d: "The Austrians have agreed and Galicia is part of our homeland once again!"
 plcommon.23.a: "Great!"

 plcommon.24.t: "Austrians Refuse our Demands!"
 plcommon.24.d: "Austrians refused our demands, stating that kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria is an integral part of their country! What shall we do?"
 plcommon.24.a: "Leave them be...!"
 plcommon.24.b: "War will solve this!"

 plcommon.37.t: "Foreign Policy"
 plcommon.37.d: "With the Commonwealth finally free from capitalist oppression we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community. While many are arguing for an immediate alliance with other Syndicalist nations, it might be wise to remain neutral to rebuild our country."
 plcommon.37.a: "Isolationism, we must organise our country."
 plcommon.37.b: "We must be proactive with the revolution!"

 plcommon.38.t: "Commonwealth Wants to Join the Syndicalists"
 plcommon.38.d: "The Government of the Commonwealth has announced that they want to join the Syndicalist bloc. It's not a sudden move because pro-Syndicalist policy is popular in many circles including the government and army. Do we want Polish workers and peasants joining the crusade against bloodthirsty Germans and rotten imperialist Canadian pigs?"
 plcommon.38.a: "YES!"
 plcommon.38.b: "Rather not."

 plcommon.39.t: "We Join the Syndicalist Bloc"
 plcommon.39.d: "The French and British are happy to see us joining the common case - destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are part of the Syndicalist bloc."
 plcommon.39.a: "This time we will win!"

 plcommon.40.t: "Anniversary of the Lublin Union"
 plcommon.40.d: "Today we celebrate the anniversary of the signature of the Lublin Union, which, for the first time in history, created a united Polish-Lithuanian state."
 plcommon.40.a: "The Commonwealth is eternal."

 plcommon.43.t: "Voldemaras' Army"
 plcommon.43.d: "Today in the Lithuanian city of Siauliai, the LTIP held a large rally in the name of Lithuanian primacy. The party's leader, Augustinas Voldemaras, preached to cheering crowds that "their worst nightmares had come true", and that "Polish rats were spreading themselves through the government like a plague". He pointed to recent governmental policies that clearly favoured Polish interests over Lithuanian ones, and found his speech received with thunderous applause. After the end of the rally, rumours have spread of the LTIP forming small militias in the name of "Protecting the Lithuanian people"."
 plcommon.43.a: "Disband them immediately!"

 plcommon.44.t: "The LTIP"
 plcommon.44.d: "A recent wave of local elections in Lithuania have revealed startling results. Voldemaras' LTIP party won a large amount of governmental offices, sweeping many rural areas and gaining a startlingly large presence in local Lithuanian politics. While the party performed poorly in areas around the capital and in Poland, the very fact that Voldemaras' speeches are reaching so many people is extremely concerning.\n\nRumours swirl of the LTIP planning to make a move on the national government, and newspapers across the nation are even predicting a permanent rift forming between the two halves of the kingdom."
 plcommon.44.a: "This is very troubling."

 plcommon.45.t: "Voldemaras' Coup"
 plcommon.45.d: "The citizens of the Commonwealth's capital awoke today to a surprising sight, thousands of Lithuanian nationals marching down the streets of the capital and demanding that their voices be heard in the government. Voldemaras' LTIP party had organised a march to the capital of the Commonwealth right under the nose of the regime, demanding both that the government be freed from "Polish meddling" and a new government be created, led by himself and his supporters. The situation is very dire, there are thousands of supporters of the LTIP Party in the capital. There is violence in the streets of the capital as nationalist rebels attempt to size control of key government buildings. Only our armed forces can save us now..."
 plcommon.45.a: "The coup succeeds."
 plcommon.45.b: "(Play as Poland)"

 plcommon.50.t: "The Reichspakt Question"
 plcommon.50.d: "With the formation of the new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, our political status in the Reichspakt alliance is unclear. While Lithuania was a member of the alliance, Poland was not, and with the combination of our two governments, it seems that there is an opportunity to use Poland's status as a member outside of the alliance to leverage our way out, if we so choose.\n\nHowever, Germany is sure to see an attempt to leave as a threat to their European hegemony, and may take action against us. What should we do?"
 plcommon.50.a: "We still need German protection."
 plcommon.50.b: "We have outgrown this decaying alliance."

 plcommon.54.t: "The PLC Joins the Internationale?"
 plcommon.54.d: "After their recent Syndicalist revolution, the new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is seeking to join the ranks of true Syndicalism worldwide, the Third Internationale. Should we allow them into our ranks?"
 plcommon.54.a: "Our brothers!"
 plcommon.54.b: "Their belief in our cause is flimsy."

 plcommon.55.t: "The Internationale Grows!"
 plcommon.55.d: "The French Commune has accepted our entry to the Third Internationale! We stand firm with our brothers in Syndicalism!"
 plcommon.55.a: "The wheels of revolution turn!"

 plcommon.56.t: "The French Commune Dismisses Polish Interest"
 plcommon.56.d: "Seemingly distrusting the new Syndicalist regime in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, France has denied our entry into the Third Internationale, stating that our belief in their ideals is too weak. Without the help of the Third Internationale, our future in Europe looks bleak."
 plcommon.56.a: "Impossible!"

 plcommon.57.t: "A New Constitution"
 plcommon.57.d: "With the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth growing stronger by the day, it is becoming increasingly clear that the current constitution cannot handle the new political realities of the Commonwealth. Thus, the king has promised sweeping reforms in writing a new constitution, but we now have to think about what the reforms should actually entail."
 plcommon.57.a: "Focus on Economic Growth."
 plcommon.57.c: "Focus on Empowering the Military."
 plcommon.57.e: "Focus on Expanding Royal Power."
 plcommon.57.f: "Focus on National Unity."

 plcommon.58.t: "The Commonwealth Seeks Plotzk"
 plcommon.58.d: "After the creation of the new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the new Commonwealth is pursuing diplomatic solutions to its territorial disputes, and is now seeking to acquire the territory of Plotzk from us, which has a large Polish majority. In exchange, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth will renounce any and all claims they hold to other Polish-majority regions we control. If we were to agree, it would cement a strong relationship with the Commonwealth. However, for us to cede any territory would certainly be seen as a sign of weakness..."
 plcommon.58.a: "It is a fair trade."
 plcommon.58.b: "Us? Surrendering territory? Unthinkable!"

 plcommon.59.t: "The Kaiser Agrees"
 plcommon.59.d: "Germany has agreed to our proposal for the cession of Plotzk in exchange for us renouncing our claims on other true Commonwealth territory they hold. With this transfer of territory, we can now welcome back millions of our brethren back into the Commonwealth proper."
 plcommon.59.a: "R-really?"

 plcommon.60.t: "An Unacceptable Trade"
 plcommon.60.d: "The Kaiser has flatly denied our request for territory, stating that they only deal with "proper nations" and that we should learn our place in the European hierarchy. It seems like we shall not be seeing Plotzk under our care for some time."
 plcommon.60.a: "To be expected..."

 plcommon.61.t: "A Referendum in Brest-Litovsk"
 plcommon.61.d: "The territories that were rightfully Polish were ceded by the Bread Peace of 1918 to the German puppet Ukraine. We should seek a diplomatic solution to this problem, and we believe that a proper referendum on the territories joining the Commonwealth is a proper way to handle this situation. There are enough ethnic Poles living in the region that a vote may turn in our favour. We should make the proposal to the Ukrainians as soon as possible."
 plcommon.61.a: "I hope they agree."

 plcommon.62.t: "A Referendum?"
 plcommon.62.d: "The new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has made a diplomatic request for a referendum to be held on the status of our border territories with their nation. If we agree, the territories will hold a vote to either stay with Ukraine, or join the Commonwealth. How should we respond?"
 plcommon.62.a: "It is the proper thing to do."
 plcommon.62.b: "Never!"

 plcommon.63.t: "The Ukrainians Agree"
 plcommon.63.d: "The Ukrainians have agreed to our referendum proposal, and the voting is due to begin shortly."
 plcommon.63.a: "Fantastic!"

 plcommon.64.t: "The Ukrainians Refuse"
 plcommon.64.d: "The Ukrainians have declined our suggestion to hold a referendum, citing our claims to the region as "outrageous" and "fantasy". This is a disappointing outcome..."
 plcommon.64.a: "We will find another way."

 plcommon.65.t: "The Referendum Begins"
 plcommon.65.d: "The agreed upon date has arrived, and along the border territories many Ukrainians are voting on whether to stay with our nation or join the Commonwealth. We could allow this voting to continue uninterrupted, or perhaps we could ensure our side won the vote..."
 plcommon.65.a: "The vote shall continue."
 plcommon.65.b: "We must win at any cost."

 plcommon.67.t: "The Referendum Succeeds!"
 plcommon.67.d: "After the votes have been tallied, our side has won the referendum! The territories our now ours!"
 plcommon.67.a: "Let's Celebrate!"

 plcommon.68.t: "The Referendum Fails!"
 plcommon.68.d: "After the votes have been tallied, our side has lost the referendum vote. It was a good attempt, at least."
 plcommon.68.a: "Unfortunate."

 plcommon.69.t: "The Commonwealth Comes Together"
 plcommon.69.d: "With the decree of Vytautas II that the kingdoms of both Poland and Lithuania shall be united as one nation, the peoples of both states have found themselves with an uncertain future. The two nations have not been together in union for over a century, and the Commonwealth's new government is in its infancy.\n\nLithuanians are already voicing concerns that the more plentiful Polish will seize effective control of the nation, and many Poles feel that a Lithuanian king will treat them as second-class citizens in favour of his own people. Tensions have been increasing across the nation, and both Populist and Syndicalist movements feed off of the distrust pervading the kingdom.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this new nation can hold itself together in the face of the coming storms..."
 plcommon.69.a: "We will stand united!"

 plcommon.70.t: "Dmowski's Speech"
 plcommon.70.d: "Roman Dmowski, leader of Polish National-Radical Party, recently said that the status of bilingualism is an abomination for Poles. He has encouraged people to destroy all signs with this 'peasant dialect' on them."
 plcommon.70.a: "He doesn't matter anymore."

 plcommon.71.t: "Voldemaras' Speech"
 plcommon.71.d: "Augustinas Voldemaras, leader of the Lithuanian nationalists, has declared that the usage of only Polish in the government is treachery against the Lithuanian nation."
 plcommon.71.a: "He doesn't matter anymore."

 plcommon.72.t: "Lithuania Rebels!"
 plcommon.72.d: "After the failed coup attempt in the capital, the Lithuanian Nationalists have been fuming under Polish rule. Today, the Lithuanian government, rallying around nationalist Augustinas Voldemaras, have declared that they will no longer be a part of a nation dominated by Polish oppressors, and have declared their total independence!"
 plcommon.72.a: "They will die for this!"

 plcommon.73.t: "Poland Rebels!"
 plcommon.73.d: "After the failed coup attempt in the capital, the Polish Nationalists have been fuming under Lithuanian rule. Today, the Polish government, rallying around nationalist Roman Dmowski, have declared that they will no longer be a part of a nation dominated by Lithuanian oppressors, and have declared their total independence!"
 plcommon.73.a: "They will die for this!"

 plcommon.74.t: "Revenge on the Commonwealth"
 plcommon.74.d: "It is time to strike back at the oppressive "Commonwealth", and erase them from the map once and for all!"
 plcommon.74.a: "Revenge!"

 plcommon.75.t: "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth leaves the Reichspakt!"
 plcommon.75.d: "Declaring that Poland's status outside of the Reichspakt Alliance has transferred to the new Commonwealth, the mutinous state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is attempting to weasel their way out of the Reichspakt! This is an obvious spit in the face of German hegemony in Europe, and if we don't act now, other states in the alliance may take notice..."
 plcommon.75.a: "Let them leave."
 plcommon.75.b: "They return or we will MAKE them return!"

 plcommon.76.t: "Germany Says "NO"!"
 plcommon.76.d: "The German ambassador to the Commonwealth today quietly delivered a sternly worded letter to Vytautas II himself. The letter written to the king himself was short and simple: any attempt to leave the Reichspakt alliance will be seen as nothing less than an attack on Germany herself. With this alarmingly short note in hand, the upper echelons of the Commonwealth government have been in talks on how to respond.\n\nIt seems likely that Germany is bluffing, but is it worth taking the risk?"
 plcommon.76.a: "The risk is too great, we must surrender."
 plcommon.76.b: "We shall call their obvious bluff!"

 plcommon.77.t: "The PLC Remains Defiant!"
 plcommon.77.d: "Despite our ambassador delivering our demands to no less than King Vytautas himself, the Commonwealth has remained suspiciously silent with regards to our demands to return to the alliance. This is obviously an affront to no less than the Kaiser himself, and the Commonwealth seems intent on their own suicide. How should we respond?"
 plcommon.77.a: "Put them down."
 plcommon.77.b: "They called our bluff..."

 plcommon.78.t: "The PLC Backs Down"
 plcommon.78.d: "After the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth so proudly declared their intention to leave the Reichspakt alliance, they have given in to our demands, and reversed their decision. The Commonwealth government quietly released a missive today stating the previous declaration was "a clerical mistake" and the idea that the Commonwealth would leave the Reichspakt "simply untrue"."
 plcommon.78.a: "They learned their place."

 plcommon.79.t: "Selecting a Prime Minister"
 plcommon.79.d: "One of the first actions the new Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth must take is to elect a Prime Minister to lead the government under our king, Vytautas II. However, in the excitement of forming a new nation and the political chaos it entails, there have been many calls to allow the people to vote on the Prime Minister, rather than having him appointed.\n\nWhile we are certainly under no obligation to allow the people to vote, it could cement Vytautas's position as a "King of the People"..."
 plcommon.79.a: "Vytautas's vote is the only one we need."
 plcommon.79.b: "The Prime Minister will be chosen by the people!"

 plcommon.80.t: "The Construction of Fort Vasa"
 plcommon.80.d: "Our Northeastern border is critically undefended. A section of our military has proposed the construction of a series of defensive structures along the border to secure its defence and ensure we are not taken unawares by a surprise invasion, likely from Russia.\n\nThe plan has been drafted, and the series of fortifications are to be collectively named "Fort Vasa" in honour of King Władysław IV Vasa, who defeated the Russians in the Smolensk War.\n\nConstruction is due to begin shortly."
 plcommon.80.a: "It will surely go as planned!"

 plcommon.81.t: "Unplanned Construction Delays"
 plcommon.81.d: "Construction of Fort Vasa has been proceeding, but not without delay. Most recently, four men were killed in an accident involving mining explosives while digging out the tunnels, and another two were killed when a section of concrete collapsed on them.\n\nMorale on the site is low, and the project is unlikely to amount to anything without continued support."
 plcommon.81.a: "We must continue."
 plcommon.81.b: "What we have now will suffice."

 plcommon.82.t: "Fort Vasa Runs out of Funding"
 plcommon.82.d: "Even with the continued support of the administration, the construction of Fort Vasa has hit another snag. The original budget had not foreseen the heavy additional costs the project is accruing, and the funding for the fortress has run dry.\n\nMore money could be allocated to the project, but is unlikely to be popular in the capital, a region far from immediate Russian threat."
 plcommon.82.a: "Allocate the funds."
 plcommon.82.b: "The fortress is complete enough."

 plcommon.83.t: "Fort Vasa is Completed"
 plcommon.83.d: "Many months of hard labour and far too many unforeseen hurdles later, "Fort Vasa" stands as testament to Polish-Lithuanian engineering, a vast network of bunkers and tunnels covering the entire Russian border, impervious to any assault.\n\nWhile many are busy celebrating the completion of such a powerful military bastion, a small flaw has been discovered in the network. A small portion of the line was left incomplete. In the grand scheme of things, insignificant, however..."
 plcommon.83.a: "Enough! It is finished."
 plcommon.83.b: "A flaw? Fix it!"

 plcommon.84.t: "Fort Vasa is Truly Completed"
 plcommon.84.d: "With the final missing section of Fort Vasa completed, the fortress stands triumphant, a shining beacon of Polish-Lithuanian military might. All defensive weaknesses have been accounted for, and some optimistic reports claim it would only need 1000 men to hold off the entire Russian army.\n\nWhatever the case, our northeastern now stands stoically defended. Fort Vasa shall not fall."
 plcommon.84.a: "A toast, to our hard workers!"

 plcommon.97.t: "Germany Demands Vytautas's Restoration"
 plcommon.97.d: "The recent election in our country has caused great alarm in Berlin. With the king removed from power and the new regime solidifying control over the country, Germany has begun to fear that the new [Root.GetName] will light a powder keg in the middle of Europe. They have decided to take immediate action, sending their ambassador to give us a list of their demands.\n\nThe demands are long and entirely unreasonable, and it is obvious Germany knows we will not accept these terms. It seems the only option left to us is to fight to the end."
 plcommon.97.a: "Arrest the ambassador!"
 plcommon.97.b: "We cannot hope to win. We surrender."

 plcommon.98.t: "Poland-Lithuania Surrenders"
 plcommon.98.d: "Our Ambassador to [POL.GetNameDef] has just returned with fantastic news. Our list of demands, written to intentionally provoke the new government, was surprisingly accepted. Polish-Lithuanian armed forces are standing down across the border and our military has been formally invited into the country to restore order.\n\nFor all the bravado and bluster Poland-Lithuania was spouting recently, they surrendered without a single shot being fired."
 plcommon.98.a: "Peace reigns supreme."

 plcommon.99.t: "Our Ambassador Arrested!"
 plcommon.99.d: "We have received alarming news from across the border in [POL.GetNameDef]. We have heard through backroom channels that after delivering our list of demands, our Ambassador was immediately arrested and thrown into prison for "Subverting the State"!\n\nThere has been a deafening silence from [POL.GetNameDef] on the matter, but or border patrols are reporting heightened military activity across the whole border. It seems that there will be no peace without war."
 plcommon.99.a: "It is war, then."

 plcommon.100.t: "Poland-Lithuania Commits to the Reichspakt"
 plcommon.100.d: "With the recent political uncertainty in the Reichspakt after the formation of [POL.GetNameDef], many observers believed that the formation of the new [PLC.GetName] was a challenge against Germany's hegemony in Eastern Europe.\n\nHowever, such worries in Berlin were quickly assuaged, as the new Commonwealth has reinforced her commitments to the German economic and military bloc, but as a partner, rather than a puppet."
 plcommon.100.a: "A pleasant surprise."
