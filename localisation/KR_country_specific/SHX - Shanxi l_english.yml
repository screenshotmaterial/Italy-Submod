#Events
 shx.0.t: "The Shanxi Clique"
 shx.0.d: "The Shanxi Clique is a Chinese warlord state led by Yan Xishan. Following their loss of territory to the Zhili Clique, and later the restored Qing Dynasty, the clique became even more isolated than it already was. They have absolutely no intention, barring territorial incursions, to enter into another Chinese conflict. However, Yan Xishan and many people in the government want to see the return of their rightful lands in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, currently occupied by the Qing. Yan is known for his opportunism, and it is highly unlikely that he will pass an opportunity for those lands up, should it present itself."
 shx.0.a: "The Neutral Clique Prospers!"

 shx.1.t: "Yan Xishan Thought"
 shx.1.d: "Yan Xishan has long been employing many aspects of different ideologies and religions in his administration. Known as Yan Xishan Thought, it has thus far managed to fall onto deaf ears. Yan Xishan yearns to change this, although whether this will actually succeed is currently unknown."
 shx.1.a: "Yan is a wise man."

 shx.2.t: "Yan and Feng Meet in Taiyuan to Discuss Funding"
 shx.2.d: "In the usual weekly meeting between Yan and Feng in Shanxi's capital, the discussion of funding for both Yan's and Feng's numerous projects has lead to several ideas being put forward with the betterment of Shanxi in mind. Both agreed that Shanxi and China as a whole require \"Western\" influence to move forward as a modern nation, though they decided that further conversation on the matter should be postponed to a later date, due to a more pressing issue: German mining companies and their "incursions" into Shanxi."
 shx.2.a: "A meeting among friends!"

 shx.3.t: "Feng Suggests Larger Funding for the Guominjun"
 shx.3.d: "Feng has suggested to Yan that in order for Shanxi to survive, it must have a strong military, and his Guominjun should fill this role. Yan advised Feng that Shanxi does not currently have additional funds for Feng's Guominjun. Feng gracefully accepted this answer and the discussion moved on to other matters in Shanxi."
 shx.3.a: "The price is too high."

 shx.4.t: "A Friendly Dinner"
 shx.4.d: "In addition to the usual weekly meeting between Feng and Yan, today the two also shared a meal together. The discussion was light, with Feng making mention of his fondness for Frank Houghton, an Anglican missionary who had praised Feng's efforts in bringing Christianity to China. Yan politely listened to Feng, then the subject changed to Yan's latest "Thought". They continued long into the night, and both retired a little wiser of each other's plans."
 shx.4.a: "A fun night was had by all!"

 shx.5.t: "Feng Ignores Yan's Authority and Secures Extra Money for the Guominjun"
 shx.5.d: "In a shocking move, Feng has secured extra funding for his Guominjun. The method is unknown to Yan, though many believe it is via his new connections to the missionaries that some say are "plaguing" Shanxi. Yan has decided to simply accept the situation, concluding that Feng is ultimately working for the good of Shanxi, and while he may have ulterior motives, there is currently little cause for concern."
 shx.5.a: "He might need a talking to."

 shx.6.t: "Yan Holds Economic Meeting"
 shx.6.d: "In a meeting held by Yan, discussion revolved around the event known as "Black Monday" and its effects on Shanxi's economy. Thus far, the effects of Black Monday have been minimal, due to Shanxi's "underdeveloped" economy.\n\nDespite Shanxi's insulation from this global crisis, Yan has nonetheless diverted funds towards Shanxi's agriculture sector."
 shx.6.a: "Our economy should be our primary focus."

 shx.7.t: "Feng Travels Through Yulin, Recruiting for the Military"
 shx.7.d: "Feng has embarked on what he has dubbed a "Good Will Tour", travelling through Yulin with his Guominjun and a band of missionaries. Along the way, he has recruited into the Guominjun anyone wishing to be baptised into the Christian faith and has continued to spread his ideas. This has brought some stability to the region, though its effects will be temporary at best, as its main goal appears to be to strengthen Feng's powerbase within the military."
 shx.7.a: "Is our army not large enough?"

 shx.8.t: "Yan Speaks to Feng about the Military"
 shx.8.d: "Yan, growing concerned about Feng's political ambitions, has spoken to him in private. The two became involved in a heated argument, with Yan demanding that the Guominjun swear loyalty to him as well as to Feng. Feng conceded, swearing that his Guominjun is loyal to Yan and to Shanxi, and then excused himself."
 shx.8.a: "There are always cracks in a friendship."

 shx.9.t: "Yan Plans Agriculture Modernisation"
 shx.9.d: "Yan has consulted the limited number of European advisors he could gather and has drawn up plans to modernise Shanxi's agricultural sector. It is Yan's hope that these methods will allow Shanxi to become more self-sustaining and to improve the conditions of those who plough Shanxi's soil."
 shx.9.a: "He is a busy man."

 shx.10.t: "Feng Holds Meeting with Government Officials"
 shx.10.d: "Feng has recently been seen speaking to members of the local government in Taiyuan. It seems he has been trying to gather support for some of his more radical ideas, and although most have ignored him, a small number are agreeing with his ideas."
 shx.10.a: "He should stick to military matters."

 shx.11.t: "German-owned Mining Companies Expand into Eastern Shanxi"
 shx.11.d: "German-owned mining companies operating through agents from the League of Eight Provinces have begun to expand in Eastern Shanxi (Jinxi). Villagers located near the mine have been forced to flee because of the environmental damages caused by the tunnelling and digging operations."
 shx.11.a: "Outrageous... those are OUR resources they are exploiting!"

 shx.12.t: "Peasants Outraged by German Exploitation"
 shx.12.d: "The extremely disruptive methods of the German mining companies have led to clashes with local peasants. While so far the protests have been minor, there are fears that tensions could boil over and disrupt the flow of resources."
 shx.12.a: "Damn."

 shx.13.t: "Northwestern Shanxi Peasants Protest Against German Encroachment"
 shx.13.d: "German companies have attempted to expand mining operations in Northwestern Shanxi and, as expected, have been met with local hostility. Unlike those in the south, the resistance in the north has been more fierce and has managed to halt most attempted operations. Peasants have denounced Yan and his government for his lack of intervention, and angry mobs have begun to form."
 shx.13.a: "We may need to assemble a peacekeeping force..."

 shx.14.t: "Feng Wants to Handle Western Shanxi Protests"
 shx.14.d: "Civil disorder continues amongst peasants in the western districts of Shanxi due to the recent expansion of League of Eight Provinces-backed companies (who are ultimately backed by the Germans). Feng has announced that he and his cohorts will quell the protests and will do so without the need for bloodshed. Those within Yan's inner circle have cautioned him that this is a ploy by Feng to garner further support, and they recommend sending someone more trustworthy to deal with the disorder."
 shx.14.a: "Good luck to him."
 shx.14.b: "No, send Lt. Wu instead."

 shx.15.t: "Feng's Northwestern Shanxi operation"
 shx.15.d: "Tensions were high when Feng and his soldiers arrived. Feng conferred with his officers and his priest, and decided to open a dialogue with the miners. After a many long, tense hours of negotiations, the miners agreed to end their protest after securing concessions from Feng. He promised to address their grievances and secure improved working conditions, as well as some other details that were not made public. Before he left, Feng lead an open prayer service with some of the peasants even joining in."
 shx.15.a: "A diplomatic success through his new Christian hobby?"

 shx.16.t: "Opium Trade in Shanxi"
 shx.16.d: "Opium, the scourge of China, is been traded and smuggled though Shanxi. Extreme measures have been enacted to ensure that those caught abusing this wretched substance are punished, with no exceptions given, neither for title nor rank. All opium smugglers will find the warm embrace of the hangman's noose."
 shx.16.a: "Damn."

 shx.21.t: "Feng Hosts a Dinner"
 shx.21.d: "Feng has hosted a dinner and seems to have invited everyone except Yan. Word has reached Yan that during the festivities, Feng was discussing the future of Shanxi, and there was also much discussion about Christianity."
 shx.21.a: "Our invite must've been lost in the mail..."

 shx.22.t: "German Mining Company Offer"
 shx.22.d: "A German mining company has approached us with a proposal that we assist them in their operations within Shanxi. They have offered Yan 30% of the profits from the mines. This move would be highly unpopular with the peasants, but it would benefit our economy."
 shx.22.a: "Take the deal."
 shx.22.b: "We refuse."

 shx.23.t: "Outrage over German Mining in Western Shanxi"
 shx.23.d: "Western Shanxi is becoming engulfed in civil strife as German mining companies have continued their relentless expansion in the area. Some in the government had predicted this outcome, as it was impossible to conceal the fact that Yan Xishan has allowed these operations to continue.\n\nIt appears the only political persona to benefit from these events is Feng Yuxiang, as the local peasants have aligned themselves with his ideology after denouncing Yan for allowing foreign companies to exploit Shanxi's resources."
 shx.23.a: "Damn."

 shx.24.t: "Feng Yuxiang Denounces German Company"
 shx.24.d: "In statements echoing the anti-concessionist rhetoric heard elsewhere in China, Feng Yuxiang has delivered a passionate speech denouncing the foreign mining companies operating in Shanxi. More and more people are attending his rallies and popular support for his ideology is on the rise."
 shx.24.a: "This will damage our relations with the Germans..."

 shx.25.t: "Opium Den Bust"
 shx.25.d: "During a recent opium den raid, several officers loyal to Yan have been caught red-handed with the vile drug, with one being Lt. Wu, a well-entrenched officer within Yan's government. As the news reached Yan, some of his advisors have suggested that the officers and officials who were arrested in the raid be given a lighter sentence, in light of their rank and position."
 shx.25.a: "No one is above the law!"
 shx.25.b: "Maybe house arrest will be sufficient..."

 shx.26.t: "Lieutenant Wu Controversy Spreads"
 shx.26.d: "The news that Yan Xishan has only given Lt. Wu and several other officers sentences of house arrest, as opposed to prison time or even hard labour, has swept across Shanxi like wildfire. Feng has taken the opportunity both to denounce the use of opium as a tool of the Devil to pacify the Chinese, and to condemn Wu and his fellow officers for their use of the drug. One thing is certain, public support for Feng is increasing more and more, while the opinion of Yan and his leadership of Shanxi is at an all-time low."
 shx.26.a: "Damn you Wu, damn you."

 shx.27.t: "Feng Brings Aid to Poor Rural Villages"
 shx.27.d: "Feng and his numerous missionaries have visited many of the poorer villages in Shanxi to give them much-needed aid. These visits have increased Feng's popularity in the rural areas, with many peasants saying they consider him to be the spiritual leader of Shanxi, rather than Yan. Furthermore, he has established several new churches, and Christianity has spread considerably.\n\nYan's advisors have strongly suggested that such excursions be stopped, as it is clear that Feng is manipulating the peasants in order to increase his popularity. Perhaps Feng's missionaries should be escorted by trustworthy government bodyguards, for their own protection of course. While in all likelihood, few people would believe this, and our move to tighten the leash on Feng would be evident to all, it would undoubtedly hinder Feng's political machinations."
 shx.27.a: "We must stop him brainwashing the masses."
 shx.27.b: "Let him do as he wants."

 shx.28.t: "Feng Meets with the Governor of Yulin"
 shx.28.d: "Feng, during his travels, has met with the Governor of Yulin. Thanks to his previous Good Will Tour, Feng is an extremely popular character in Yulin. Worryingly, details of the discussion between Feng and the governor have not yet reached Yan Xishan and his trusted ministers. This suggests that Feng and his Guominjun have been able to increase their internal security and thwart our attempts to spy on their activities."
 shx.28.a: "Damn his political manoeuvring."

 shx.29.t: "Yang Hucheng Discusses Military Policy"
 shx.29.d: "Yang Hucheng has proposed some changes to Shanxi's military policy. His proposed alterations, though small, would put Shanxi on a more aggressive footing. Feng Yuxiang has supported this change, stating that Shanxi should not remain passive as the myriad turmoils of China continue to unfold around us."
 shx.29.a: "Keep it the same."
 shx.29.b: "Increase it."

 shx.31.t: "Shanxi Moves Troops into Gansu"
 shx.31.d: "With all our troops on the frontlines, our local garrisons and peacekeeping forces have been severely depleted. Fighting desperately to reverse our numerous military defeats at the hands of the foreigners, we have been unable to maintain public order in our territories. In the meantime, troops from our neighbours in the Shanxi Clique have crossed the border into Lanzhou, ostensibly to safeguard the population against banditry or reprisals by foreign troops. As our military cohesion is tenuous, we can ill afford to risk opening yet another front against Shanxi."
 shx.31.a: "We cannot afford another war."
 shx.31.b: "Resist those traitors!"

 shx.32.t: "The Mas Surrender"
 shx.32.d: "Our troops have swiftly and efficiently occupied Lanzhou, with the few remaining local garrison troops yielding peacefully to our forces. It seems that, given their current situation, the Ma leadership has chosen to allow our occupation to proceed."
 shx.32.a: "Excellent!"

 shx.33.t: "The Mas Resist"
 shx.33.d: "The local garrisons and remaining reserves in Lanzhou have resisted our incursion into Gansu province, and we have received a defiant message from the Ma leadership: they demand that we remove our troops from the region immediately, or else it will be seen as an act of war. It seems that our hopes of a peaceful occupation have been dashed, and despite their precarious military position, the Ma clan is prepared to fight us in order to defend their territory."
 shx.33.a: "We are already committed, war it shall be!"
 shx.33.b: "Back down, we cannot afford this war."

 shx.50.t: "Miners Put Down"
 shx.50.d: "In an unfortunate turn of events, the forces under Lieutenant Wu were unable to resolve the conflict peacefully, and had to use force to suppress the riots. Feng has responded with a fiery speech denouncing what he calls the "Jinxi Massacre". "Such conduct by military officers is unacceptable," Feng claims, "for these men were sent to protect these people, not slaughter them." Feng's speech has rallied miners and labourers across the province, and he has promised that those officers responsible for the massacre will be held accountable for their actions."
 shx.50.a: "What is he up to?"

 shx.60.t: "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within the Military"
 shx.60.d: "Feng's popularity within the military is becoming worrisome for those who are aligned with Yan. Some fear that if this continues to happen then Feng will have complete loyalty of the military and may ask his dear friend Yan to "step aside". Only time will tell..."
 shx.60.a: "Disturbing..."

 shx.61.t: "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within Shanxi"
 shx.61.d: "Feng's recent political programs and initiatives have begun to bear fruit, with numerous groups from peasants to official magistrates beginning to show their support for Feng. If this trend continues, Feng will secure control of the government, effectively removing his dear friend Yan from his position."
 shx.61.a: "Distressing..."

 shx.63.t: "Feng's Bloodless Coup"
 shx.63.d: "Feng has secured the support of both the government and the military, and has taken control of Shanxi in a bloodless coup. Yan Xishan has decided to gracefully step aside, given that he considers Feng's vision for the future of Shanxi as sufficiently similar to his own (despite Feng's zealous Christianity). Feng has allowed Yan to remain in an advisory post, as Yan's insights may well be required in the challenges that are sure to come in the future.\n\nChristian missionaries are holding special services, with hundreds coming forth to be baptised across Shanxi, further cementing Feng's Christian powerbase among the population of Shanxi. In one peculiar incident, due to the high volumes of those seeking to be baptised, Feng – ever the pragmatist – suggested using a fire hose to "Baptise the Masses". This was frowned upon by his missionaries, although it did have its desired effect. Time will tell how Feng, his Christianity, and his "Pragmatism" will continue to shape Shanxi and even China as a whole."
 shx.63.a: "Pragmatic indeed..."

 shx.64.t: "Feng Yuxiang Desires an Alliance"
 shx.64.d: "Feng Yuxiang, the leader of the Guominjun in Shanxi, has approached us with a request for a formal military alliance. While he could be a very useful ally, he is also extremely zealous in his spiritual pursuits and may hold ulterior ambitions for the future of China."
 shx.64.a: "We shall accept."
 shx.64.b: "Feng cannot be trusted."

 shx.65.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Alliance"
 shx.65.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted an alliance with Feng."
 shx.65.a: "Excellent."

 shx.66.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Alliance"
 shx.66.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused an alliance with Feng."
 shx.66.a: "Their loss."

 shx.300.t: "The Question of Workers' Rights"
 shx.300.d: "There are two schools of thought in Shanxi about workers' rights: The first is allowing bureaucrats to introduce reforms that will more or less favour employers and businesses in Shanxi. The second is ensuring that workers' rights are protected, despite the disadvantages this presents to business owners and foreign investors."
 shx.300.a: "The bureaucrats will introduce reforms. Foreign capital is a must."
 shx.300.b: "Ensure that all citizens in Shanxi are protected. The foreigners must abide by our laws."

 shx.301.t: "The Question of Landowners"
 shx.301.d: "China is a nation in which, like many nations in the west, a few individuals own vast swaths of land, with indentured peasants working the land. New reforms could abolish these practices, with land reforms allowing the peasants to become owners of their own lands, the former landowners being forced to sell these lands to the government.\n\nAnother option is to compromise with the landowners, setting caps on their taxation of peasants, which could eventually lead to the peasants being able to afford their freedom. This option is favoured by Yan's advisors, as it would allow gradual change as opposed to radical land reforms."
 shx.301.a: "China will reform gradually, we must compromise with landowners."
 shx.301.b: "We require radical land reforms, force the landowners to sell."

 shx.302.t: "Successful Land Reform"
 shx.302.d: "Our efforts at land reform are beginning to pay serious dividends. Opium fields have been eradicated, and production of food crops has increased. Furthermore, now that some farmers are starting to own their own land, there are serious incentives to increasing efficiency, and new techniques to improve yields and reduce soil erosion are being implemented."
 shx.302.a: "Excellent news!"

 shx.401.t: "Shanxi Petitions Germany for Weapons"
 shx.401.d: "Our diplomats have prepared a formal request for German aid in the form of arms shipments. If they accept, they will demonstrate that they are committed to sensible government and good relations in China."
 shx.401.a: "Further assistance for our cause."

 shx.402.t: "Shanxi Requests Armaments"
 shx.402.d: "Shanxi, a small warlord state in China, has petitioned us for arms."
 shx.402.a: "Let us give them some rifles."
 shx.402.b: "We have no interest in Shanxi."

 shx.403.t: "The Germans Accept!"
 shx.403.d: "The Germans have granted our request for armaments, and the shipments are already under way."
 shx.403.a: "With their help, we shall defend ourselves."

 shx.404.t: "The Germans Deny Our Request!"
 shx.404.d: "The Germans have refused our request for arms. This is a dark day for Sino-German relations."
 shx.404.a: "No matter, we shall stand on our own."

 shx.405.t: "Shanxi Petitions Russia for Weapons"
 shx.405.d: "Our diplomats have prepared a formal request for Russian aid in the form of arms shipments. If they accept, they will demonstrate that they are committed to sensible government and good relations in China."
 shx.405.a: "Further assistance for our cause."

 shx.406.t: "Shanxi Requests Weapons"
 shx.406.d: "Shanxi, a small warlord state in China, has petitioned us for arms."
 shx.406.a: "Let's give them some rifles."
 shx.406.b: "We have no interest in Shanxi."

 shx.407.t: "The Russians Accept!"
 shx.407.d: "We have received confirmation that the Russian government has agreed to supply us with Mosin-Nagant rifles. Our quartermasters will surely be grateful for the assistance."
 shx.407.a: "Excellent."

 shx.408.t: "The Russians Deny Our Request!"
 shx.408.d: "The Russians have denied our request for aid."
 shx.408.a: "No matter, we shall stand on our own."

 shx.409.t: "An Imperial Province"
 shx.409.d: "Due to our support for the Manchu coup, Governor Yan Xishan has taken it upon himself to rechristen himself as an 'Imperial Governor', and adopt an Imperial provincial flag in support of the new regime in Beijing."
 shx.409.a: "Great!"

Although Xishan holds strong control over the government of Shanxi, his power directly over the military is lacking. Yuxiang, on the other hand, has always held strong influence in the military, due to his leadership of the Guominjun, but has never held much influence in the broader government.

###Reuse in new Feng tree
 #"The Guominjun was founded out of desperation. When popular liberation had so nearly been secured, its leaders were betrayed. Finding sanctuary in Shanxi, they have grown stronger and the people have now become desperate. With enthusiasm the people have brought the men of the Guominjun to power. Here we shall build a land like no other, where no man shall hunger in body or soul."
 #"God so loved humanity that He sent His only Son to die for us. Yet almost two millennia later so many in China know not of The Son or his message of progress. Through sweeping principled education reform perhaps that can be addressed."
 #"Heaven rewards those who work hard. Indeed, it was a particular cultural affinity for this religious value which allowed the west, and particularly Protestant nations, to develop rapidly. We must promote such an ethos."
 #"Shanxi has always been under threat, and with the radical ideas of the Guominjun now being implemented, the danger of conquest has increased further. The entire state bureaucracy must be reorganised and physically relocated to operate from defensible positions."
 #"With their expulsion from Gansu, the Guominjun's organisational structures were fractured. With control of Shanxi, we should begin to reconstruct the Guominjin itself, separate from, but intimately intertwined with the apparatus of the state."
 #"Beyond agriculture, cottage industries dominate the economy of Shanxi. Perhaps with state provision of certain traditional sectors and incentivisation, some may truly embrace industry of the modern kind from their own homes. As The Lord was a carpenter, artisans and craftsmen the masses shall be."
 #"The production of sufficient small arms to suit the needs of not only the army but the masses as well is essential for our defence. We must encourage new cottage industrialists to take up gunsmithing in particular."
 #"We have transformed the foundations of society and we must now make clear in ideological terms the necessity of the coming struggle. The final fate of Shanxi, and all China, hangs in the balance."
