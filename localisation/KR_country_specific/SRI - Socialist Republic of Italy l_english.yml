### Events ###
 socitaly.1.t: "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
 socitaly.1.d: "In 1919, the Italians signed an armistice with the Austrians, ending the war for the Kingdom of Italy. However, the brave socialists and nationalists in Italy rose up against the destructive Savoyards, determined to replace their system with something better. Even King Victor Emanuel and his son’s abdication was not enough to stop the will of the people, and civil war broke out across Italy. Even as we pushed the royalists out of northern Italy, however, there were traitors in our own ranks. The “Whites” in the republican uprising, unwilling to accept the inevitability of the revolution, broke with our movement and soon sold themselves out completely to the Austrians. With our enemies all united against us, our advances were halted on the Po and on the Abruzzo line, and the war was over.\n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, three Congresses have come and gone, and revolutionary fervour has spread to every corner of northern Italy. Much has been done to uplift the Italian peasantry from their previous conditions, but much still remains to do."
 socitaly.1.a: "Forward!"

 socitaly.200.t: "Uniting Italy"
 socitaly.200.d: "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italy once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and British into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Republic of Italy to the east is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"
 socitaly.200.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

### Fourth Congress ###
 socitaly.2.t: "Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy"
 socitaly.2.d: "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacalista seek to push orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Partito Socialista Italiano desire a government that supports a more moderate approach to bringing socialism to the country. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
 socitaly.2.a: "Let's get to work!"

 socitaly.3.t: "Day 1: Economic Policy"
 socitaly.3.d: "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Partito Socialista Italiano advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes. The Unione Sindacalista argue for furthering syndicalist economic policies so as to develop the nation into a proper industrial democratic republic. Mussolini's Unione Nazionalista, for their part, demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation, implemented by a powerful central government."
 socitaly.3.a: "We must expand our agriculture."
 socitaly.3.b: "We should focus on industrialisation."
 socitaly.3.c: "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

 socitaly.4.t: "Day 2: Internal Policy"
 socitaly.4.d: "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. The Unione Sindacalista's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Partito Socialista Italiano's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead. Unione Nazionalista's representative argued that it is the Chairman of the Republic that should be empowered."
 socitaly.4.a: "Focus on empowering the Communes"
 socitaly.4.b: "Focus on empowering the Unions"
 socitaly.4.c: "Focus on Empowering the Chairman"

 socitaly.5.t: "Day 3: Religious Policy"
 socitaly.5.d: "The final order of business is the status of Christianity within the republic. The Partito Socialista Italiano, while an atheist party in nature, say that Italian culture is bound up with that of the Catholic Church. Trying to divorce the two would be folly, so they say a common ground must be found where the Church can work with the government rather than against it. The Unione Nazionalista, on the other hand, claim that Christianity is archaic and unsuited for the modern age, and that a state atheism which forces religion out of daily life will break the chain of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacalista support a status quo of official secularism, where the government is non-religious in all matters and neither works with the church nor against it."
 socitaly.5.a: "Support common ground with the Church!"
 socitaly.5.b: "Support secularism!"
 socitaly.5.c: "Support state atheism!"

 socitaly.6.t: "Partito Socialista Italiano Majority!"
 socitaly.6.d: "The Partito Socialista Italiano has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now, two leading members of the faction can assume the role of Chairman, Giacomo Matteotti or Giuseppe Romita. Who shall be elected the new Chairman?"
 socitaly.6.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Matteotti!"
 socitaly.6.b: "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"

 socitaly.7.t: "Unione Sindacalista Majority!"
 socitaly.7.d: "The Unione Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now, two leading members of the faction can assume the role of Chairman, Palmiro Togliatti or Alceste De Ambris. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"
 socitaly.7.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"
 socitaly.7.b: "Congratulations, Comrade De Ambris!"

 socitaly.8.t: "Unione Nazionalista Majority!"
 socitaly.8.d: "The Unione Nazionalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. With this victory, Benito Mussolini is now the new chairman."
 socitaly.8.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"

 socitaly.9.t: "No Majority Achieved!"
 socitaly.9.d: "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
 socitaly.9.a: "Damn it!"

 socitaly.10.t: "Unione Sindacalista and Partito Socialista Italiano Compromise"
 socitaly.10.d: "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacalista and Partito Socialista Italiano have agreed to form a coalition government. Palmiro Togliatti is to maintain his role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti will become the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
 socitaly.10.a: "Better than nothing."

 socitaly.11.t: "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
 socitaly.11.d: "During the recent Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy, none of the three factions were able to achieve a clear majority, and the government has collapsed into deadlock. This would normally not be our concern, but the Italians' inability to compromise is only destabilising an ally which is already unsteady on its feet. Perhaps we can help them choose their new government?"
 socitaly.11.a: "Support the Partito Socialista Italiano!"
 socitaly.11.b: "Support the Unione Sindacalista!"
 socitaly.11.c: "Support the Unione Nazionalista"
 socitaly.11.e: "It's not our problem."

 socitaly.16.t: "French Support the Partito Socialista Italiano"
 socitaly.16.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Partito Socialista Italiano. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
 socitaly.16.a: "The Partito Socialista Italiano will be the new government!"
 socitaly.16.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

 socitaly.17.t: "French Support the Unione Sindacalista"
 socitaly.17.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Sindacalista. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
 socitaly.17.a: "The Unione Sindacalista will be the new government!"
 socitaly.17.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

 socitaly.18.t: "French Support the Unione Nazionalista"
 socitaly.18.d: "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Nazionalista. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
 socitaly.18.a: "The Unione Nazionalista will be the new government!"
 socitaly.18.b: "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

### NeoSanfedisti ###

 socitaly.19.t: "Suppression of Catholics"
 socitaly.19.d: "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise, the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it is dealt with readily."
 socitaly.19.a: "It must be done, for the greater good"

 socitaly.20.t: "Northern Catholics Suppressed"
 socitaly.20.d.nosic: "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war. There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."
 socitaly.20.d.sic: "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation.

While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins. This would, of course, depend on whether we get the blessing of [SIC.GetNameDef], who would be forced to come to our rescue if such a war began."
 socitaly.20.a: "We will fund the Neosanfedisti resistance!"
 socitaly.20.b: "No, it is far too great a risk"

 socitaly.21.t: "Northern Catholics Suppressed"
 socitaly.21.d: "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war."
 socitaly.21.a: "These people are innocent of all but faith!"

 socitaly.22.t: "The NeoSanfedisti"
 socitaly.22.d: "The NeoSanfedisti - literally 'the new holy faithful men', named after an eighteenth-century Italian terrorist organisation - has begun attacking government installations all over the republic. Aiming to create as much havoc as they can in the name of the 'oppressed' Catholic Church, the NeoSanfedisti could tie up much of our resources if their actions continue."

 socitaly.29.t: "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
 socitaly.29.d: "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This is a serious blow to the Catholic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
 socitaly.29.d.last: "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [SRI.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other Catholic agitators get similar ideas in the future."

 socitaly.30.t: "Foreign Support for the NeoSanfedisti"

Many citizens of [SRI.GetNameDef], both within the Congress and the general public, cry out for vengeance, although some caution that we may not yet be ready for the war against the south."

 socitaly.31.d: "Pope [PAP.GetLeader] has issued a call to the NeoSanfedisti faithful, and they have answered in large numbers, raising troops in Central Italy behind our lines. Apparently they have been planning this for some time, and [PAP.GetNameDef] has been supplying them with training and equipment. It seems we did not find their ringleaders quickly enough."
 socitaly.31.a: "It will make no difference"

 socitaly.32.t: "Policy Towards the Church"
 socitaly.32.d.radsoc: "While the policy of the Partito Socialista Italiano is to work with the Church, our support of the Worker-Priest movement has created mixed reactions amongst the faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
 socitaly.32.d.synd: "While the policy of the Unione Sindacalista has been to ignore matters of faith, many within our government say our support of the Worker-Priest movement has violated our traditional neutrality. What's more, it's causing mixed reactions amongst the country's faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
 socitaly.32.a: "Come down hard on this resistance"
 socitaly.32.b: "Ease back on our support - the movement should be voluntary"

 socitaly.33.t: "Assessing the Economy"
 socitaly.33.d: "The economy of the country has been suffering in recent years. While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must consider ways to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first, favoured by the Partito Socialista Italiano, would focus on decentralising our industry by empowering the various communes throughout the country. The second plan, put forth by the Unione Nazionalista, is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions in order to bring prosperity to Italy and its people."
 socitaly.33.a: "Support the Communal Syndicalism plan"
 socitaly.33.b: "Support the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale plan"

 socitaly.34.t: "Reviewing the Guards"
 socitaly.34.d: "The Red Guards, or Guardia Rosse, have been the backbone of the Socialist Republic of Italy's army since the civil war. Organised as local militias, they have major support among the local communes that field and equip them. However, with some nationalists seeking to reunify Italy, plans have been put forth to reform the Red Guards into a true Red Army. However, such a plan is controversial for many members of the Red Guards that are highly suspicious of a centralised military apparatus, despite the benefits that it will bring."
 socitaly.34.a: "Support the Red Guards"
 socitaly.34.b: "Create the Red Army!"

 socitaly.35.t: "Military Research Focus"
 socitaly.35.d: "With the Red Army now in place, it is time for the research committee to help better focus our efforts."
 socitaly.35.a: "Focus on advanced electronic research"
 socitaly.35.b: "Focus on furthering tank research"
 socitaly.35.c: "Focus on rocketry and nuclear research"

 socitaly.36.t: "Declare War on the Socialist Republic?"
 socitaly.36.d: "The Socialist Republic of Italy is at war with the Two Sicilies. Some within the parliament are auguring that this is a golden opportunity to unite the Republic, while others suggest biding our time. What shall we do?"
 socitaly.36.a: "Declare war!"
 socitaly.36.b: "We will bide our time."

 socitaly.37.t: "Declare War on the Socialist Republic?"
 socitaly.37.d: "The Socialist Republic of Italy is at war with the Papal States. We should rally to the defence of the Pope!"
 socitaly.37.a: "Defend the Pope!"

 socitaly.38.t: "Awarding Naval Contracts"
 socitaly.38.d: "We have two union-owned and -operated shipyards which are vying for the government contracts. One, the Cantieri Navali Riuniti, specialises in smaller ships, while the other, the Cantieri Navali Livorno, specialises in capital ships. We will have to select where our focus lies."
 socitaly.38.a: "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Riuniti"
 socitaly.38.b: "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Livorno"

 socitaly.40.t: "Italy is United!"
 socitaly.40.d: "At long last, Italy has been reunited, and the revolution has spread to every corner of the peninsula! Today is a great day and shall be considered a national holiday. Let all Italians rejoice now that Italy is reunited!"
 socitaly.40.a: "Viva l'Italia!"

 socitaly.41.t: "Fifth Congress"
 socitaly.41.d: "Today, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. Delegates from all the unions across Italy have convened for the Congress, which is the first to be held in Rome and in a united Italy. Celebrations are being held throughout the nation, and Rome in particular, in honour of this momentous event."
 socitaly.41.a: "Let's get to work!"

 socitaly.42.t: "The Fate of the Pope"
 socitaly.42.d: "One of the first issues on the agenda is what is to be done with the Pope. The Partito Socialista Italiano argue that the government has no business interfering with the Catholic Church, and that the Pope should be left alone. The Unione Sindacalista believe that the throne of Saint Peter's should be occupied by a socialist. Finally, the Unione Nazionalista argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"
 socitaly.42.a: "Leave the Church alone."
 socitaly.42.b: "Install a Red Pope."
 socitaly.42.c: "Exile the Pope from Italy."

 socitaly.43.t: "Internal Policy"
 socitaly.43.d: "The second matter on the Fifth Congress's agenda is how to handle the issue of dissidents in the Republic. Not all within the Republic are accepting socialism, particularly in the areas where the reactionaries held sway prior to the Second Risorgimento. The Partito Socialista Italiano argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacalista believes that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Unione Nazionalista, for their part, wants to empower the Ministry of Public Security to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"
 socitaly.43.a: "The dissidents are not a threat."
 socitaly.43.b: "Increase the propaganda to support the Republic."
 socitaly.43.c: "Arrest the dissidents and those who help them!"

 socitaly.44.t: "Italy's Place on the World Stage"
 socitaly.44.d: "The next order of the Congress is to decide on what role the Socialist Republic of Italy shall play within the International and on the world stage. Until the Second Risorgimento, the Republic was focused on reuniting Italy, but now that that goal has been achieved, Italy's political future must be determined. The Unione Nazionalista believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while the Unione Sindacalista believe the focus should be first on Europe. Finally, the Partito Socialista Italiano believe Italy's role is to help nurture socialism within Italy and the members of the International first."
 socitaly.44.a: "Nurture socialism from within"
 socitaly.44.b: "A European revolution!"
 socitaly.44.c: "A world revolution!"

 socitaly.45.t: "Partito Socialista Italiano Victory"
 socitaly.45.d: "The Partito Socialista Italiano has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. They must now determine who is to lead the country. Comrades Olindo Vernocchi, Gaetano Salvemini, Giuseppe Romita, and Giacomo Matteotti are the leading candidates to assume the role of Chairman. Who shall it be?"
 socitaly.45.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Vernocchi!"
 socitaly.45.b: "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"
 socitaly.45.c: "Congratulations, Comrade Salvemini!"
 socitaly.45.e: "Congratulations, Comrade Matteotti!"

 socitaly.46.t: "Unione Sindacalista Victory"
 socitaly.46.d: "The Unione Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. The question is, who shall be the Chairman? The leading candidates are Comrade Giuseppe Di Vittorio, Alceste De Ambris, Comrade Palmiro Togliatti, and Comrade Angelo Tasca. Who shall be elected?"
 socitaly.46.c: "Congratulations, Comrade Di Vittorio!"
 socitaly.46.e: "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"
 socitaly.46.b: "Congratulations, Comrade Tasca!"
 socitaly.46.a: "Congratulations, Comrade De Ambris!"

 socitaly.47.t: "Unione Nazionalista Victory"
 socitaly.47.d: "The Unione Nazionalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government."
 socitaly.47.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"
 socitaly.47.b: "Congratulations, Comrade Bianchi!"

 socitaly.48.t: "No Majority Achieved!"
 socitaly.48.d: "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
 socitaly.48.a: "A compromise must be found!"

 socitaly.49.t: "Unione Sindacalista and Partito Socialista Italiano Compromise"
 socitaly.49.d: "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacalista and Partito Socialista Italiano have agreed to form a coalition government. Alceste De Ambris will assume the role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
 socitaly.49.a: "Better than nothing"

 socitaly.50.t: "Prisoner of the Vatican"
 socitaly.50.d: "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
 socitaly.50.a: "Exile the Pope!"
 socitaly.50.b: "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"
 socitaly.50.c: "Just let him complain"

 socitaly.51.t: "The Papal Conclave Begins"
 socitaly.51.d: "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
 socitaly.51.a: "They shall choose right!"

 socitaly.52.t: "A New Pope"
 socitaly.52.d: "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
 socitaly.52.a: "Yay!"

 socitaly.53.t: "Exiling the Pope"
 socitaly.53.d: "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
 socitaly.53.a: "Get out of here!"

 socitaly.54.t: "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
 socitaly.54.d: "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
 socitaly.54.a: "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

 socitaly.65.t: "The Vatican Commune"
 socitaly.65.d: "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
 socitaly.65.a: "Thank you, Holy Father!"

 socitaly.66.t: "Revolutionary Irredentism"
 socitaly.66.d: "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Congress take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Unione Nazionalista call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
 socitaly.66.a: "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."
 socitaly.66.b: "Austrian comrades and Maltese comrades both."
 socitaly.66.c: "Greater Italia shall be the light of socialism!"

 socitaly.67.t: "The New Lands"
 socitaly.67.d: "It has been some time, but we have finally liberated our comrades. Now that socialism has come to the new lands of the republic, we can be secure knowing that we shall be a beacon of socialism within the International."
 socitaly.67.a: "Avanti Italia!"

 socitaly.68.t: "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
 socitaly.68.d: "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
 socitaly.68.a: "Lenient. We already have our victory."
 socitaly.68.b: "Make an example of them."

 socitaly.69.t: "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
 socitaly.69.d: "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
 socitaly.69.a: "Turn them over to the local communes."
 socitaly.69.b: "Make them government headquarters."
 socitaly.69.c: "Make them youth camps."

 socitaly.70.t: "Resistance to Secularism"
 socitaly.70.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
 socitaly.70.a: "They will learn in time."

 socitaly.71.t: "Christian Socialist Policies Help"
 socitaly.71.d: "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our Christian socialist policies are proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
 socitaly.71.a: "Thank God!"

 socitaly.72.t: "Land Reform in Southern Italy"
 socitaly.72.d: "Now that we have control of Southern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Congress will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
 socitaly.72.a: "Break the chains!"

 socitaly.73.t: "Industrialisation for the South"
 socitaly.73.d: "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
 socitaly.73.a: "Progress moves south!"

 socitaly.74.t: "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
 socitaly.74.d: "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker cooperatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionising the new regions."
 socitaly.74.a: "Focus on the unions."
 socitaly.74.b: "Focus on communal farming."
 socitaly.74.c: "Focus on worker cooperatives."

 socitaly.75.t: "New Communes"
 socitaly.75.d: "With the rest of Italy now under our control, new revolutionary communes are being formed throughout the Republic, from Lombardy and Venetia to Sicily and Naples. These communes have become new social centres and bases for spreading the revolution in the areas."
 socitaly.75.a: "Lunga Vita ai Comuni!"

 socitaly.76.t: "Resistance to Social Changes"
 socitaly.76.d: "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
 socitaly.76.a: "Damn reactionaries!"

 socitaly.77.t: "The Ministry of Public Security help prevent trouble"
 socitaly.77.d: "The Ministry of Public Security have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
 socitaly.77.a: "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

 socitaly.78.t: "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
 socitaly.78.d: "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
 socitaly.78.a: "Long live the Fasci!"

 socitaly.79.t: "Exhibition of the Revolution"
 socitaly.79.d: "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
 socitaly.79.a: "Long live the Republic!"

 socitaly.80.t: "Women Entering Politics"
 socitaly.80.d: "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the National Congress since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Congress itself."
 socitaly.80.a: "Great!"

 socitaly.84.t: "Female Red Guard Divisions"
 socitaly.84.d: "With the decision to create the Gruppi di Difesa della Donna, a number of women have formed their own defence unit based out of the city of Livorno. These women have called their unit the Prospero Brigade in honour of the minister who helped create the Gruppi in the first place."
 socitaly.84.a: "We need every man and woman we can get!"

 socitaly.85.t: "The Worker-Priest Movement"
 socitaly.85.d: "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
 socitaly.85.a: "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

 socitaly.86.t: "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
 socitaly.86.d: "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Christian Socialist Union within the National Congress."
 socitaly.86.a: "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

 socitaly.87.t: "Futuristic Architecture"
 socitaly.87.d: "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Unione Nazionalista. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
 socitaly.87.a: "The Future is now!"

 socitaly.88.t: "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
 socitaly.88.d: "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in Florence in the 1920s, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
 socitaly.88.a: "Culture belongs to the masses!"

 socitaly.89.t: "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
 socitaly.89.d: "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
 socitaly.89.a: "We shall see."

 socitaly.90.t: "1937 Championship between Bologna and Torino"
 socitaly.90.d: "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Torino playing against Bologna. The Bulls against the Greyhounds. Bologna is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Torino team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
 socitaly.90.a: "Who shall win, indeed!"

 socitaly.91.t: "Bologna Wins 1937 Championship game!"
 socitaly.91.d: "It was a close match, but Bologna won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bologna is celebrating this victory."
 socitaly.91.a: "The Greyhounds remain the champions!"

 socitaly.92.t: "Torino Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
 socitaly.92.d: "In a stunning upset, the Torino team defeated Bologna 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Torino will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
 socitaly.92.a: "The Bulls are the new champions!"

 socitaly.100.t: "The Founding of Cinecittà"
 socitaly.100.d: "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Florence. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
 socitaly.100.a: "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

 socitaly.101.t: "Death of Filippo Turati"
 socitaly.101.d: "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Torino was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
 socitaly.101.a: "The passing of a torch."

 socitaly.102.t: "Maggio Musicale Fiorentino"
 socitaly.102.d: "In the city of Florence, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
 socitaly.102.a: "Opera for the People!"

 socitaly.103.t: "Enrico Fermi creates the Pisa Pile-1"
 socitaly.103.d: "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Pisa Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Pisa, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
 socitaly.103.a: "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

 socitaly.104.t: "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
 socitaly.104.d: "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Pisa since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
 socitaly.104.a: "A hero of the Republic!"

 socitaly.105.t: "Commune of San Marino"
 socitaly.105.d: "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."
 socitaly.105.a: "Greetings Comrades!"

 socitaly.106.t: "Roma Jazz Festival"
 socitaly.106.d: "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
 socitaly.106.a: "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

 socitaly.107.t: "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
 socitaly.107.d: "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
 socitaly.107.a: "Let the race begin!"

 socitaly.108.t: "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
 socitaly.108.d: "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularised his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
 socitaly.108.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

 socitaly.109.t: "Spartacus is Released"
 socitaly.109.d: "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
 socitaly.109.a: "I am Spartacus!"

 socitaly.110.t: "Comrade Ines Donati"
 socitaly.110.d.ines_elected: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been elected for the rank of general in the Red Guards. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
 socitaly.110.d.ines_promoted: "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been promoted within the Red Army. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
 socitaly.110.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Donati!"

 socitaly.111.t: "The Grande Rivoluzione Culturale Proletaria Begins"
 socitaly.111.d: "Comrade Mussolini spoke before a massive crowd today in Rome, declaring that Italy must be purged of all elements of reactionary and capitalist thought, and that the new futurist culture of Italy shall rise from its ashes to build an Italy that is the culmination of the declaration of revolution in 1919."
 socitaly.111.a: "We must cleanse Italy of corruption!"

 socitaly.112.t: "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
 socitaly.112.d: "'With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with the ancients, and the pedantry and academic formalism that have strangled our society. The past is feudalistic and capitalistic and must be wiped away. The Socialist Republic has no need for the past!' according to a state paper in Torino."
 socitaly.112.a: "The past is gone!"

 socitaly.113.t: "Spontaneous Revolutionary Violence"
 socitaly.113.d: "The leader of the Ministry for Public Security has declared that it will be of no issue if reactionaries are killed by revolutionary violence. This has sparked a wave of violence throughout the country as people engage in spontaneous revolutionary violence against those considered reactionary. When this will be over, no one knows. But the reactionaries shall be purged!"
 socitaly.113.a: "Death to the reactionaries!"

 socitaly.114.t: "Bonfire of the Vanities"
 socitaly.114.d: "In Florence, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires. Artwork from before the creation of the Socialist Republic of Italy, books that promoted reactionary thought or un-socialist principles, and household goods deemed bourgeois were also destroyed. This bonfire has been copied by other cities across the republic as many seek to destroy the culture of the past."
 socitaly.114.a: "Destroy the capitalist vanities!"

 socitaly.115.t: "Purging the Reactionaries"
 socitaly.115.d: "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better. People like Achille Grandi, Giacomo Matteotti, and Giuseppe Saragat are all reactionaries that must be purged! They and others will only corrupt the ideals of socialism and bring back capitalism to the Republic. This will not be allowed!"
 socitaly.115.a: "We shall not be corrupted!"

 socitaly.116.t: "Destruction of Churches"
 socitaly.116.d: "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"
 socitaly.116.a: "Death to superstition!"

 socitaly.117.t: "Technicians in the Country and Bureaucrats in the Factories"
 socitaly.117.d: "The Republic is to not be a bureaucratic republic. However, in the years since its foundation, that has been changing and bureaucrats have been coming back within the government and within the workplaces. In order to make sure that the republic is not bureaucratised, factory technicians and leaders will be made to spend time in the countryside and government bureaucrats will be made to spend time within the factories."
 socitaly.117.a: "Break the chains!"

 socitaly.118.t: "Quotations from Chairman Mussolini"
 socitaly.118.d: "In order to spur on the Cultural Revolution, the thoughts and quotes of Benito Mussolini have been made into a small book that has been printed en masse for citizens to study as they try to follow in the footsteps of the Chairman."
 socitaly.118.a: "Heed the wise words of Comrade Chairman Mussolini."

 socitaly.119.t: "Futurist Food"
 socitaly.119.d: "As the cultural revolution continues, a book called the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking has been published. Its purpose is to ensure that even the daily habits of eating are transformed. The book has some choice words reserved for pasta; 'No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion,' a position backed up by Mussolini himself, who is quoted as saying 'a nation of spaghetti eaters cannot have a social revolution'"
 socitaly.119.a: "Food of the future!"

 socitaly.120.t: "The Strength of the Army"
 socitaly.120.d: "As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Army has become more and more important in keeping order and stability. However, within the upper echelons of command, some have started to wonder if the methods of the cultural revolution are productive in building a new society and culture for Italy."
 socitaly.120.a: "The Army will protect the revolution, of course."

 socitaly.121.t: "Destruction of Estates"
 socitaly.121.d: "Many noble estates in the south have been destroyed. The lands of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies held a number of noble estates, and the people in the south have finally decided to destroy these estates and make sure that there is no trace of the relics of the old feudal order."
 socitaly.121.a: "Death to feudalism!"

 socitaly.122.t: "Mussolini's Personality Cult"
 socitaly.122.d: "A cult of personality has begun to grow around Mussolini, thanks to his efforts at using his personal charisma as well as the mass media from newspaper to film to make sure that his image is respected and supported. Portraits of Mussolini have popped up in public and private spaces alike throughout the country."
 socitaly.122.a: "All for Mussolini!"

 socitaly.123.t: "Revolutionary Films"
 socitaly.123.d: "To build a new culture, we must destroy the old one. Archaic plays and operas are no longer to be performed. Instead, using the new film industry, a new culture celebrating the revolution and the Republic will be created. Mussolini, in particular, is sponsoring new actors, actresses and directors that will praise the Cultural Revolution."
 socitaly.123.a: "Film will bring about a new culture."

 socitaly.124.t: "End of the Cultural Revolution"
 socitaly.124.d: "Tragically and somewhat mysteriously, Mussolini has died in a plane crash. With his death, Michele Bianchi has assumed control of the Republic. Bianchi has declared that the Cultural Revolution has been victorious and as such, it should come to an end. With its end, he has begun to slowly scale back some of the 'reforms' that were passed during the Revolution, notably the enforcement of futurist food."
 socitaly.124.a: "The Revolution is over."

 socitaly.125.t: "The End of the Revolution"
 socitaly.125.d: "Mussolini has declared in Rome that the Cultural Revolution is now at an end. The reactionary culture that has infected Italy since the Republic was declared is gone. Today, the sun shines on a new Italia, and the violence and chaos that has reigned over Italy has begun to subside. Life has been changed, but the Republic has been made stronger; or at least, that is what Comrade Mussolini says. It is clear, though, that his grip on power is now absolute."
 socitaly.125.a: "The Revolution is over."

 socitaly.126.t: "Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
 socitaly.126.d: "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
 socitaly.126.a: "It will change nothing"

 socitaly.127.t: "The Balance in Italy"
 socitaly.127.d.ita: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbours due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. With [ITA.GetNameDef] drawing in its own allies into the war, the situation has now officially changed: the balance is broken."
 socitaly.127.d.sic: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbours due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians.

 socitaly.127.d.srd: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbours due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. With [SRD.GetNameDef] drawing in its own allies into the war, the situation has now officially changed: the balance is broken."
 socitaly.127.d.ger: "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbours due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. With the Germans now at war with the syndicalists themselves, the situation has now officially changed: the balance is broken."

 socitaly.127.a: "We can call for aid!"
 socitaly.127.b: "This means trouble..."
 socitaly.127.c: "I see"

 socitaly.128.t: "An Invitation"
 socitaly.128.d: "Now that all bets are off regarding the so-called 'balance' in Italy, [From.GetNameDef] has extended a formal invitation for [SRI.GetNameDef] to join the ranks of the Third Internationale."
 socitaly.128.a: "At last!"
 socitaly.128.b: "On second thought, no..."
