### Army Reform
 china_army_decisions: "Army Reform"
 china_army_decisions_desc: "Chinese armies have long struggled to catch up to Western standards. Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

 lepwar.3.desc.good: "When a man believes that victory is close at hand, he will fight harder and better, it is often said. Whether or not this is true, recent battlefield success have done well to boost morale, having a positive effect on the war effort."
 lepwar.3.desc.bad: "A string of mistakes, setbacks, and plain bad luck have meant that our forces have been unable to meet their objectives. We are failing to make significant gain, and as the war drags on, more men begin to question our cause, leaving the army to return home or become bandits."

 lepwar.4.desc.good: "With recent victories on the battlefield, our men have recently captured a supply depot full of enemy weapons! Though retreating forces had tried to leave nothing for us, the speed of our advance caught them off guard."
 lepwar.4.desc.bad: "With a series of defeats on the battlefield, morale has sunk to a new low. While retreating from advancing enemy forces, a group of soldiers sent to bring supplies further towards the capital instead deserted and took the supplies with them. This represents both a breakdown in general discipline and a heavy loss for our logistics situation."

 lepwar.5.t.good: "[THIS.GetLeader] Praised"
 lepwar.5.t.bad: "[THIS.GetLeader] Attacked"
 lepwar.5.desc.good: "Recent advances in the war have done well to strengthen [THIS.GetLeader]'s position. Members of the government once critical of his rule have begun to fall silent, while supporting voices have grown louder. If this trend continues, the war will see a swift conclusion."
 lepwar.5.desc.bad: "Recent setbacks in the war have brought increasing criticism upon [THIS.GetLeader]'s leadership. Voices opposed to his rule have grown louder, with rumours of plots to remove him circulating, while promised victories seem to be slipping further and further away. If this trend continues, [THIS.GetNameDef] may collapse along internal divisions long before an enemy army takes [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 lepwar.5.a: "It's only right"
 lepwar.5.b: "Can't they just shut up?"

 lepwar.6.t: "Defectors from Anqing"
 lepwar.6.desc: "It seems that with the collapse of the Anqing Clique, a number of warlords, generals, and petty despots tainted by Chen Tiaoyuan's association with the Japanese have chosen place their bet on [SQI.GetLeader] rather than risk retribution from the Kuomintang. There skills will surely prove an asset to us."
