 kr.political.100.d: "While [Root.GetNameDef] still labours under [overlord_name.GetAdjective] control, the [Root.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over our own borders that a semblance of greater autonomy is now possible to exert. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean we no longer have to rely on [overlord_name.GetAdjective] troops to secure our borders."
 kr.political.100.a: "Excellent"

 kr.political.101.t: "Order Restored in [From.GetNameDef]"
 kr.political.101.d: "While [From.GetNameDef] still labours under [Root.GetAdjective] control, the [From.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over its own borders that a semblance of autonomy is now possible. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean they no longer have to rely on [Root.GetAdjective] troops to secure their borders, and are thus not so tightly under our control."
 kr.political.101.a: "So be it"

 kr.political.102.t: "Greater [Root.GetAdjective] Autonomy?"
 kr.political.102.d.tfv: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [overlord_name.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to surely lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs. Surely our [overlord_name.GetAdjective] will not be able to resist us for long."
 kr.political.102.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [overlord_name.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs, and the effect is being felt throughout the country."
 kr.political.102.a: "Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!"

 kr.political.103.t: "Greater [From.GetAdjective] Autonomy"
 kr.political.103.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to lessen as their strength reasserts itself.

 kr.political.106.t: "The Struggle for Independence"
 kr.political.106.d.tfv: "[overlord_name.GetAdjective] control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. We are too powerful for them to contain.

 kr.political.107.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] control over the [From.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. They are too powerful for us to fully contain. There is a general clamouring among the [From.GetAdjective] people for [From.GetNameDef] to be set free, and now their government has officially submitted a demand for full independence."
 kr.political.107.a: "Let them go, while we're still friends"
 kr.political.107.b: "Are they joking? Forget it"

 kr.political.108.t: "Independence Refused"

 kr.political.110.a: "Yes, let's end this"
 kr.political.110.b: "No! This is about more than independence now!"

 kr.political.111.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] War for Independence"
 kr.political.111.d: "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has gone on for some time, with neither of us able to gain a clear advantage. Perhaps it is time to simply recognise their independence and be done with it."

 kr.political.250.c: "On second thought..."

 kr.political.251.t: "Free [marked_country.GetNameDef]?"

Use at your own risk!!§!"

 kr.political.252.t: "Join the [to_be_faction_leader.GetFactionName]?"
 kr.political.252.d: "This will make [marked_country.GetNameDef] join the [to_be_faction_leader.GetFactionName], dismantling their own faction if they're a faction leader or simply leaving their current faction if they're in one.

 kr.political.255.d: "[marked_country.GetNameDefCap], along with all its allies, will white peace with [peace_target.GetNameDef] and all of their allies.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!"
 kr.political.255.b: "Separate [marked_country.GetNameDef] from its allies, then peace out"

 kr.political.256.t: "Peace out of all wars?"
 kr.political.256.d: "[marked_country.GetNameDefCap] will make a separate white peace for all its current wars. If it is a subject, it will first be freed, and if it is in a faction, it must first leave it.\n\n§RNOTE: This may very well break Kaiserreich content! Use at your own risk!!§!"
