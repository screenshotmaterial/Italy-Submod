 black.2.t: "Black Monday"
 black.2.d: "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market, panic selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning.\n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."

 black.3.t: "Black Monday"
 black.3.d: "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged.

### Socialism and Black Monday ###
 comfrance.999.t: "Capitalist Economies Collapse!"
 comfrance.999.d: "Over the past few days, the workers and peasants of the world have watched as the bankers, capitalists, and tyrants scrabble to reap the benefits of the workers’ labour for their own selfish gain. They call it Black Monday, a terrible event they say! They say that such a collapse was completely uncalled for, something no economist could have predicted! Of course, the workers are no fools. The people see through their lies.\n\nAs the great philosopher Karl Marx predicted, such collapses are an inevitable result of capitalism. As the capitalist abuses and reaps the benefits of the workers, they begin to eat themselves alive like rabid dogs. All this as they leave their workers to struggle and die by the waste as they scramble for the last piece of meat.\n\nOur nation, however, has decoupled itself from the capitalist world and has begun the construction of a true people’s state. Therefore, we remain unaffected and can only watch as the nations of the world are eaten alive by their capitalist overlords. This is a great awakening for the peasants and workers of the world and soon, the workers of these nations will begin to organise against their oppressors. We must stand by, and stand tall as a true example for the workers of the world!"
 comfrance.999.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"
