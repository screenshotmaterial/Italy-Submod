 POLITICS_KARL_ALBRECHT_DESC:0 "Karl Albrecht von Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Polish.

### Events ###
 gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
 gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
 gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
 gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

 gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
 gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish and Romanian territory."
 gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

 gal.3.t:0 "Galicia Desires Union with Poland"
 gal.3.d:0 "The former Austrian territory of Galicia-Lodomeria seems to have found itself in a state of limbo as of late. Acquired by the Habsburgs in 1772 during the partitions of Poland, the region is inhabited by a mix of Poles and Ukrainians who have not developed much of an attachment to a Galician identity - instead, they have preferred to identify more strongly with their respective countrymen elsewhere. As such, few have come to regard the satellite state that we have established in the region as anything more than a temporary measure that will be merged into another nation in time.\n\nNow that Poland is under the control of an allied government, the Poles of Galicia have decided that this time is now - we have received a request from [From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] petitioning us to approve a union between Poland and Galicia-Lodomeria. While most among our government are sympathetic towards this request, there is a complication: this union would also bring a significant number of Ukrainians under the Polish flag, a prospect that not everyone is eager for. For their part, the government in Warsaw insists that the Ukrainians will be welcomed as fellow countrymen, but some diplomats believe that our needs are better met by keeping the states separate regardless. Should we allow the union to proceed?"
 gal.3.a:0 "Of course."
 gal.3.b:0 "No, we prefer them kept separate."

 gal.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Union with Poland"
 gal.4.d:0 "Excellent news - our request to merge with our Polish countrymen has been approved! Preparations for the merger have already begun in earnest, as the border between us is set to become history."
 gal.4.a:0 "Send an envoy to Warsaw!"

 gal.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Union with Poland"
 gal.5.d:0 "Tragically, [FROM.GetNameDef] denied our request for a union with Poland, citing strategic concerns. It seems that we are fated to remain apart for some time to come."
 gal.5.a:0 "Damn you!"

 gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
 gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Władysław Sikorski in charge of Galicia in his absence."
 gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."
