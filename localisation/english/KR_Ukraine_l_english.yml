### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
 POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Rada and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
 POLITICS_DANYLO_DESC:0 "King Danylo Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Danylo however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadsky's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
 POLITICS_BULGAKOV_DESC:0 "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
 POLITICS_DONTSOV_DESC:0 "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. His organisation, the OUN has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."

 language_issue_desc:0 "The centuries-long Russian dominance of Ukraine and suppression of the Ukrainian language has produced a sizeable Russian-speaking minority, or perhaps even majority, in Ukraine.

 Hetman_army:0 "Hetman's Army"
 Hetman_army_desc:0 "The Hetman of Ukraine, general Pavlo Skoropadskyi, supported by Germany, undermined Austrian influence in Ukraine following the 1927 Austrian Ausgleich renegotiations. The political strife between the military, dominated by the Hetman, and the Ukrainian Rada, headed by the king, has left Ukraine's military in such disarray that even personal reconciliation between the Hetman and Rada would seem to be insufficient; the Ukrainian military is in dire need of reform."

### Events ###
 ukraine.1.t:0 "Our Kingdom"
 ukraine.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadskyi, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic. For a time the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally over Ukrainian rumbled on after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise whereby King Vasyl, an Austrian archduke born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who as the German-allied 'Hetman', holds incredible powers of both civil and military affairs. By 1927, German involvement in the Austrian Ausgleich negotiations meant that Ukraine fell de-facto into the hands of the Hetman, with King Vasyl becoming an increasingly marginalised figure. Ukraine under the Hetmanate has become the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, and made its wealthy landowners exorbitantly wealthy, but at the expense of the Ukrainian peasantry. Now, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg the national situation is unstable. The Reich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to nations within its sphere of influence while Syndicalists gain popularity amongst the downtrodden rural poor and city workers with each passing day. Both ethnic Russians and the pro-Russian population dream of unification with our former master to the East while Ukrainian nationalists proclaim that our Kingdom is no more than a German puppet. This is a immutable truth. Despite these many issues afflicting us, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people industrious and our potential boundless."
 ukraine.1.a:0 "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"

 ukraine.2.t:0 "The Ukrainian Government"
 ukraine.2.d:0 "It is fair to say that our government is divided. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi does his best to solve the antagonism between the army, consisting of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army, and the civil administration, most of which actively supports our current position in the Reichspakt, many of Ukraine's problems can only be solved when the majority of our population - the kulaks and peasants - have an opportunity to sell their substantial agricultural produce in Europe beyond the narrow confines of the Reichspakt."
 ukraine.2.a:0 "We shouldn't provoke the peasants!"

 ukraine.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
 ukraine.3.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash's shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
 ukraine.3.a:0 "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."

 ukraine.4.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis!"
 ukraine.4.d:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
 ukraine.4.a:0 "We're still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"

 ukraine.5.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
 ukraine.5.d:0 "Before the agricultural crisis pro-Russian movements were rather weak and disunited, ensuring they didn't pose much of a threat to our government. This crisis has led to a shocking rise in popular support for these organisations and an increase in their willingness to cooperate. Yesterday a famous Russian writer from Kiev, Mikhail Bulgakov, proclaimed the unification of the three largest movements into a singular organisation known as 'Faith and Nation' ('Vera i Narod') or just 'ViN'. Supported by the Ukrainian Church, itself heavily influenced by the Moscow Patriarchate, the population of Southern and Eastern Ukraine and many high-ranking officers, this movement could provoke serious instability in some parts of our country."
 ukraine.5.a:0 "We really must protest!"

 ukraine.6.t:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky returns from Africa"
 ukraine.6.d:0 "Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a young and talented officer, has returned to Ukraine. He was a member of the voluntary Ukrainian division, which supported our German allies in regional conflicts in the Mittelafrikan bush. His books 'On the Banks of the Congo' and 'Safari' previously made him the most popular Ukrainian soldier and writer in the entire country. Chernyakhovsky has been promoted to the rank of Colonel and will soon become the commander of the 1st Cossack Division ('Serdyutskaya'), which ensures this popular figure will command an elite branch of the Ukrainian army."
 ukraine.6.a:0 "Welcome home Ivan!"

 ukraine.7.t:0 "Dmytro Dontsov Deported From Galicia and Lodomeria"
 ukraine.7.d:0 "Dmytro Dontsov, a renowned ideologue of Ukrainian nationalism, has been deported from Galicia, where he had been carrying out operations to urge the local Ukrainian minority to resist the Austro-Hungarian administration. He now claims that our silence on the crisis has exposed the weakness of our government, and that's why Ukraine should be ruled by 'real Ukrainian patriots'. His slogan 'Ukraine for the Ukrainians' is attractive to many citizens, especially in Western Ukraine, and graffiti has been spotted in a number of towns. This could be dangerous for the cabinet, since we've already lost considerable support in the East."
 ukraine.7.a:0 "Welcome home I suppose..."

 ukraine.8.t:0 "Shumsky criticises the Ukrainian government."
 ukraine.8.d:0 "Oleksander Shumsky, a prominent Ukrainian syndicalist, has opened the 3rd Congress of the Left SRs. He demands that the government takes extreme measures to defend the workers and peasants from poverty brought on by the global crash. To further this agenda he has proposed a new programme of major social and economic reforms aimed at helping Ukraine overcome the crisis. The controversial figure is going to present his plan in the Rada soon."
 ukraine.8.a:0 "Extreme measures? This stinks of Bolshevikism!"

 ukraine.9.t:0 "Our Future"
 ukraine.9.d:0 "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and the stability of many of the nation's most important institutions. The King's grip on the country is weakening by the hour, peasants loyal to the Hetman want major land reform, pro-Russian malcontents and Ukrainian nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists are mobilising workers all over the country. Various political movements struggle for power in our teetering nation, and soon we have to choose who will lead Ukraine into the future."
 ukraine.9.a:0 "Ukraine will stagger on as it always has!"

 ukraine.10.t:0 "Shumsky's Speech"
 ukraine.10.d:0 "As one of the few syndicalists in the Rada, Oleksander Shumsky wields an mesmerising degree of influence over the Ukrainian peasantry and urban rabble. He has taken advantage of our troubles in a recent speech, where he has openly called for sweeping land reforms, an extension of the electoral franchise and an end to landlord dominance in the countryside. These demands are extremely popular among the lower classes, and are giving them ideas dangerous to national stability. Despite this, perhaps we could make use of Shumsky's popularity and allow him to become the face of economic reforms unpopular amongst the rural landlords that we would otherwise take a political hit over anyway."
 ukraine.10.a:0 "The King dismisses Skoropadskyi and invites Shumsky to head a popular government!"

 ukraine.11.t:0 "The Language Issue"
 ukraine.11.d:0 "Oleksander Shumsky has joined the government as leader during one of the darkest periods in our nation's history since 1918. However, before solving the economic problems it is imperative that Shumsky respond to the burgeoning pro-Russian movement, which has had a malign impact on our electorate in industrial Ukraine. One method that could help neutralise their popularity is by addressing the language question, a domestic dilemma that has been lingering for years. The Russian language is used de-facto by a substantial percentage of the population, however its usage is expressly prohibited in state institutions. This has given rise to accusations that Russians are treated as second-class citizens."
 ukraine.11.a:0 "Make Russian the second official state language."
 ukraine.11.b:0 "Arrest important pro-Russian leaders."

 ukraine.12.t:0 "National-Syndicalists Protest!"
 ukraine.12.d:0 "Notable Ukrainian National-Syndicalists Vlas Chubar and Yurii Lapchynsky oppose Shumsky's decision to allow the usage of the Russian language in administrative institutions. They claim that this measure won't help to unify our country and that unopposed usage of the Russian language will lead to the growth of the separatist organisations in Southern and Eastern Ukrainian."
 ukraine.12.a:0 "Millions of our workers don't think so."
 ukraine.12.b:0 "All right, all right. Restore the status quo."

 ukraine.13.t:0 "Pro-Russian Leaders Stir Up Trouble"
 ukraine.13.d:0 "Leaders of the different pro-Russian movements have unfortunately managed to escape Ukrainian soil before they could be arrested. Many have sought temporary exile in Romania and Russia, with both nations somewhat hostile to our pro-German regime and aware of the Kaiser's gaze turning west. Mikhail Bulgakov has announced publicly that the nationalist umbrella organisation 'Faith and Nation' is ready to fight for the rights of Russians in Ukraine. Maybe we have made a big mistake."
 ukraine.13.a:0 "Another problem!"

 ukraine.14.t:0 "Profits From Increased Taxation on the Kulaks"
 ukraine.14.d:0 "Our decision to raise taxes on the Kulak landlords and spend this money on the poorest peasants has helped to stabilise our agriculture sector. 60-70% of the state and private farms are estimated to now be entirely self-supporting. As a result of our increased support from the villages and farms we can turn to other pressing issues with our faltering economy."
 ukraine.14.a:0 "That's one fire extinguished."

 ukraine.15.t:0 "Another Crisis!"
 ukraine.15.d:0 "Our government's decision to divide the property of the Kulaks has led to a second crisis among the farmers. Our collectivisation attempts have ended in a total failure, with agricultural yields from the new collectivised farms cumulatively less than the smallholdings that they replaced. Unbelievably the situation in Ukraine has managed to deteriorate even further!"
 ukraine.15.a:0 "Proof that Syndicalism doesn't always work."

 ukraine.16.t:0 "The Fate of the Ukrainian Monarchy"
 ukraine.16.d:0 "His Majesty King Vasyl I Vyshyvaniy gave Oleksander Shumsky extensive powers in a bid to control the revolutionary trends sweeping the country in the aftermath of the crisis. Now that Shumsky's initial programme has been implemented successfully, many interest groups within Ukraine have begun debating the continued prominence of the monarchy considering its relative powerlessness in the face of recent crises."
 ukraine.16.a:0 "The bourgeoisie like liberty, but would prefer a less radical government."
 ukraine.16.b:0 "The poor love Shumsky, but hate the King! Long live the Republic!"

 ukraine.17.t:0 "A New Minister of Security?"
 ukraine.17.d:0 "Igor Kistyakovsky has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
 ukraine.17.a:0 "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'"
 ukraine.17.b:0 "Vladimir Chekhovsky from 'OUN'"
 ukraine.17.c:0 "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."

 ukraine.18.t:0 "Free Trade Area With the Ukraine"
 ukraine.18.d:0 "The new Ukrainian government has sought to reconstruct the economy by establishing a free trade area between the Ukraine and the Russian market. This virtual erasure of eye-watering tariffs and customs duties at the border would be a substantial boon for our own merchants and industrialists. Furthermore, opening up the largely agrarian Ukrainian market to Russian importers desperate to feed the austerity-hit masses in Russia's major cities would massively boost our economy..."
 ukraine.18.a:0 "Launch this project!"

 ukraine.19.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
 ukraine.19.d:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our urban poor now have access to cheap Ukrainian grain to supplement their diet. The unemployment rate has been reduced substantially in certain key sectors. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian cooperation!"
 ukraine.19.a:0 "Great."

 ukraine.20.t:0 "Free Trade Area Results in Profits"
 ukraine.20.d:0 "The free trade area with Russia has shown its benefits. The borderlands, which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg, are now home to a number of new collieries and ironworks and our grain, previously rotting in the fields, now has access to a massive market in the form of the Russian urban poor. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian cooperation!"
 ukraine.20.a:0 "Great."

 ukraine.21.t:0 "Prosvita is Effective!"
 ukraine.21.d:0 "The activities of the Prosvita Movement have had a demonstrably positive influence on our youth, with membership numbers soaring into the hundreds of thousands at least. A number of young people are ready to defend their country, culture and traditions. They will be perfect recruits for our armed forces."
 ukraine.21.a:0 "That's right young men, enrol in the army!"

 ukraine.22.t:0 "Regional Languages"
 ukraine.22.d:0 "Though Skoropadskyi refused to recognise the Russian language as a second state language, he allowed the Ukrainian regions to choose which languages could be officially recognised. Now that the majority of our regions have recognised the Russian language, Skoropadskyi has finally conceded to give it the same position on a national scale."
 ukraine.22.a:0 "'Yazyk' and 'Mova' should have a common future in Ukraine!"

 ukraine.23.t:0 "Ukraine Request Recovery Aid"
 ukraine.23.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has asked us for a relatively substantial loan, which they wish to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. One of our major Reichspakt allies and the bastion of our Ostwall against a Russian resurgence, Ukraine's situation is already incredibly unstable, in part due to our protectionist measures during Black Week that proved detrimental to Ukrainian agriculture."
 ukraine.23.a:0 "Very well. Grant them the money."
 ukraine.23.b:0 "Who cares about Ukraine?"

 ukraine.24.t:0 "Germany Grants Us a Loan!"
 ukraine.24.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request! Now we can invest this money into the electrification of the villages in Central Ukraine, which promises to increase our support amongst the peasantry, boost our agricultural productivity and improve our rural economy. Germany's decision is perhaps not surprising. Ukraine is, after all, a much better place to invest in than Poland!"
 ukraine.24.a:0 "Germany is truly our friend and protector!"

 ukraine.25.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
 ukraine.25.d:0 "With the aid of loans from the German government, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
 ukraine.25.a:0 "Great!"

 ukraine.26.t:0 "Germany Has Declined to Grant Us a Loan!"
 ukraine.26.d:0 "The German Empire is not going to help us with investment. We must either increase our taxes or abandon this plan."
 ukraine.26.a:0 "We can use our own resources. Time to raise the taxes."
 ukraine.26.b:0 "These reforms weren't necessary anyway..."

 ukraine.27.t:0 "The Electrification is Complete!"
 ukraine.27.d:0 "Even though Germany refused to grant us loans, our government has finally been able to electrify virtually all of the villages in Central Ukraine through increased taxation, greatly improving the agricultural yields of our peasant farms. As a result of this and our previous measures Ukraine has finally begun to recover from the crushing effects of Black Monday."
 ukraine.27.a:0 "It was worth it."

 ukraine.28.t:0 "Another Ukrainian Loan"
 ukraine.28.d:0 "The Ukrainian government asked us for a loan again, which they want to use for the industrialisation of the Eastern part of the Ukraine to quell Syndicalist power there. However, the size of this loan is much bigger than the one before. Many senior personnel in our administration believe that the rise of Syndicalism in Ukraine is a direct threat to Reichspakt solidarity."
 ukraine.28.a:0 "Very well, give them the money."
 ukraine.28.b:0 "There is a crisis in Germany, you know."

 ukraine.29.t:0 "Germany Granted Us Another Loan"
 ukraine.29.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our request for further capital! Now we can invest this money into the industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine. It should help us to defeat the burgeoning Syndicalist movement there."
 ukraine.29.a:0 "Very well."

 ukraine.30.t:0 "Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
 ukraine.30.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by the loan from Germany. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
 ukraine.30.a:0 "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"

 ukraine.31.t:0 "Germany Refused A Second Loan!"
 ukraine.31.d:0 "The Germany Empire is not going to help us with investment in our industrial East, shortsightedly forgetting that the more power Syndicalism gains in Eastern Europe, the greater the threat to their interests. We must choose whether to increase our taxes or abandon this plan entirely."
 ukraine.31.a:0 "Time to raise taxes."
 ukraine.31.b:0 "It's too damn expensive!"

 ukraine.32.t:0 "The Industrialisation of Eastern Ukraine"
 ukraine.32.d:0 "Many workers in Eastern Ukraine have gotten new jobs in emerging industries due to our investment there, funded by extra taxes levied on the population. As a result our loyalty amongst the urban poor has grown immensely, greatly neutering the power of the Syndicalist movement there. We have recovered from Black Monday, while also crippling the power base of the trade unions!"
 ukraine.32.a:0 "Two birds with one stone. Fantastic!"

 ukraine.33.t:0 "Ukraine asks for help!"
 ukraine.33.d:0 "Ukraine, a new Syndicalist nation in Eastern Europe led by Oleksander Shumsky, has requested our support. They cannot start the reform of their industry alone and they have turned to friendly nations overseas for help. There are some plans that have been proposed by our economy minister - the question is which one should we choose?"
 ukraine.33.a:0 "Time to help their military industry!"
 ukraine.33.b:0 "Let's build a brewing facility in Kiev!"
 ukraine.33.c:0 "They can do everything without us."

 ukraine.34.t:0 "Syndicalist Ukraine Leaves the Reichspakt"
 ukraine.34.d:0 "The treacherous Ukrainians have deserted the Reichspakt, jeopardising the sphere of influence in Eastern European that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the general staff have suggested direct military action to punish the new Syndicalist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. Members of the Abwehr have instead suggested that we ought to use our ties with many senior Ukrainian army officials to instigate a reactionary coup d'etat in Kiev. The choice now is how we should react to this clear betrayal."
 ukraine.34.a:0 "We do not have the resources to respond."
 ukraine.34.b:0 "Covert operation should resolve this."
 ukraine.34.c:0 "Crush the Syndicalist traitors!"

 ukraine.3400.t:0 "War with Germany!"
 ukraine.3400.d:0 "Our ex-overlords in Germany seem angered that we have finally chosen to follow our own destiny. Already German troops mass at the border and we must fight for our freedom!"
 ukraine.3400.a:0 "We must resist the imperialists!"

 ukraine.35.t:0 "German Military Mission Leaves the Ukraine"
 ukraine.35.d:0 "Following our decision to leave the hated the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally left! Already, officers and advisors that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol and the capital Kiev, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine."
 ukraine.35.a:0 "The chains are broken, for now at least."

 ukraine.36.t:0 "'Arsenal'"
 ukraine.36.d:0 "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kiev organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker's revolt in Kiev. After the triumph of Syndicalism in Ukraine however, the French Commune has decided to help us with the revival of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
 ukraine.36.a:0 "God bless the French."

 ukraine.37.t:0 "Ukraine Requests To Join The Internationale"
 ukraine.37.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine have recently announced their intention of joining the Syndicalist bloc in the face of German reactionism in Eastern Europe. Unlike the vast majority of Internationale members Ukraine's Syndicalist government stems not from revolutionary activity, but working with monarchists and German stooges in government - making them most unorthodox. Still, Ukrainian peasants would be useful in the crusade against the bloodthirsty Germans and Canadian pigs."
 ukraine.37.a:0 "Together we shall envelop the hated Bosche!"
 ukraine.37.b:0 "Their chain-breaking credentials are... unworthy."

 ukraine.38.t:0 "We Join the International"
 ukraine.38.d:0 "The International is happy to see us joining the common cause, namely, destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are in the Syndicalist bloc we are part of a united struggle that stretches from Luhanks to London. Only together can we survive in the face of reactionary terror."
 ukraine.38.a:0 "We will defend our liberty and independence!"

 ukraine.39.t:0 "Attempt at a Military Coup"
 ukraine.39.d:0 "German agitators, with the help of reactionary officers and a part of our armed forces, have launched a coup against our government and are trying to restore the pro-German regime in Ukraine. Elements of the Military Mission that had previously been deployed in key garrisons on the Ostwall, in Sevastopol port and in the capital joined forces with pro-German troops and have started running street battles near the ministry buildings. The country is in absolute chaos and liable to deteriorate further, with the survival of Syndicalism in Ukraine on a knife-edge. How will the situation develop?"
 ukraine.39.a:0 "The reactionary putschists secure Kiev!"
 ukraine.39.b:0 "The Red militias successfully defend Kiev!"

 ukraine.40.t:0 "Reactionary Coup in the Ukraine Succeeds"
 ukraine.40.d:0 "Members of the German Military Mission together, with reactionary members of the Ukrainian armed forces, have successfully seized control of Kiev, overthrowing the Syndicalist government and replacing it with one again loyal to the German Empire. After a number of street battles and open warfare raging in government buildings, the putschists began purging Reds wherever they could find them. A nervous King Vasyl was given sweeping powers by a pliant Rada and again signed Ukraine up as a formal member of the Reichspakt. We have successfully prevented the poison of Syndicalism from spreading any further in Eastern Europe, and for this the Abwehr should be commended."
 ukraine.40.a:0 "Excellent!"

 ukraine.41.t:0 "Military Coup in the Ukraine Failed"
 ukraine.41.d:0 "Our attempt to replace the government in Ukraine with one loyal to our state has failed miserably. Though our Military Mission staff and a number of anti-Syndicalist elements of the Ukrainian army managed to launch a coup d'etat in Kiev and seize a number of government buildings, they were swiftly overwhelmed by Red militias and executed en-masse. What should we do now? Already widows of the fallen are baying for blood."
 ukraine.41.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
 ukraine.41.b:0 "War will solve this!"

 ukraine.42.t:0 "'Obolon'"
 ukraine.42.d:0 "Oleksander Shumsky knows that the workers and peasants of Ukraine deserve a chance for a happier, better life, which is why he always pays serious attention to the needs of the ordinary people. The French government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. The Commune has offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"
 ukraine.42.a:0 "An astute proposal!"

 ukraine.43.t:0 "No support from France!"
 ukraine.43.d:0 "Though the Commune of France knows about our internal problems, it seems that they are not going to help us... at least for the moment. This is perhaps not too surprising given the situation that they find themselves in. Despite the setback, we have to be persistent and hope that we will improve our relations with the strongest Syndicalist nation in the world in future."
 ukraine.43.a:0 "Let's hope they won't forget us completely."

 ukraine.45.t:0 "Ukrainian Demands"
 ukraine.45.d:0 "Yesterday, the Ukrainian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region that we seized back in 1918. If we fold to the Ukrainian claims, we will lose a substantial portion of our territory and besmirch the dignity of the Homeland, but if we refuse, we could very well face an immediate invasion by our powerful neighbour. How should we react to these dreadful demands from our northern rival?"
 ukraine.45.a:0 "Accept their demands."
 ukraine.45.b:0 "Never! Bessarabia is Romanian!"

 ukraine.46.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 ukraine.46.d:0 "The leadership of [FROM.GetNameDef] have published a note, which insists that Bessarabia is rightful Romanian territory, and that no Ukrainian soldier will set foot on its sovereign territory. The treatise is filled with xenophobic remarks and references to history which have caused outrage and dismay in government circles, and upon it being leaked to the press, the wider public. The Romanians have given us great offence."
 ukraine.46.a:0 "Then it is war!"
 ukraine.46.b:0 "Return Bessarabia."

 ukraine.52.t:0 "An Heir to King Vasyl?"
 ukraine.52.d:0 "Unfortunately, our King has no children and as such theoretically has the right to choose his successor. In practice however, this decision is up to the Ukrainian government itself and only two candidates are even being considered by senior ministers. The nephew of Vasyl, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. 'ViN' and 'OUN' support Danylo as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo, despite his dynastic ties, only has support from Skoropadskyi's opponents and employers, many of whom have serious connections with Germany and Austria. The question now is which is preferable."
 ukraine.52.a:0 "Leo Stefan Habsburg!"
 ukraine.52.b:0 "Danylo Skoropadskyi!"

 ukraine.53.t:0 "A New Minister of Security?"
 ukraine.53.d:0 "Igor Kistyakovsky has been our minister of Security since 1918 but recently had to retire from his post because of his poor health. 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have immediately started fighting for this position because each party hopes to increase their influence over Ukrainian internal policy. We have to give 'ViN' or 'OUN' this post, according to the power-sharing agreement concluded before the elections."
 ukraine.53.a:0 "Vladimir Khitrovo from 'ViN'."
 ukraine.53.b:0 "Vladimir Chekhovsky from 'OUN'."
 ukraine.53.c:0 "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of our Hetman."

 ukraine.54.t:0 "Explosion on the Dnieper"
 ukraine.54.d:0 "Today at 11 a.m. while our King Vasyl was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. Our minister of security has just received a telegram from a Syndicalist group claiming responsibility for mining His Majesty's yacht, stating that the action was as a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save our King and already the country has been plunged into disorder with rioting throughout all the major cities and fears that a military coup is imminent."
 ukraine.54.a:0 "Mikhail Bulgakov and ViN perform a bloodless coup!"
 ukraine.54.b:0 "Dmytro Dontsov and the OUN overthrow the government!"
 ukraine.54.c:0 "Long live King Danylo and our Hetman Skoropadskyi!"
 ukraine.54.e:0 "Long live King Leo-Stefan and the landowners!"

 ukraine.62.t:0 "Ratification of the Treaty of Pereyaslav"
 ukraine.62.d:0 "Since the dismemberment of the Russian Empire after the Weltkrieg, both Russia and the Ukraine have been independent countries with their own destinies. At the same time, both states have proven to be weaker apart than united. Now, with each state having reached some level of domestic stability, more and more citizens in both nations are calling for reunification particularly due to the rule of the Russophile Vera i Narod party in Ukraine. Although it could lead to a split with the Reichspakt this might be the one great chance for Great and Little Rus to reunite into a resurgent Greater Russia - a state that can confidently oppose Germanic hegemony in Eastern Europe. Now that we have received a Ukrainian proposition for reunification, how should we react?"
 ukraine.62.a:0 "Return to Mother Russia, Ukraine!"

 ukraine.64.t:0 "Russian Annexation of the Ukraine!"
 ukraine.64.d:0 "Terrible news from Ukraine. The pro-Russian government has decided to unify with our Russian rivals, throwing our entire Eastern Policy into complete disarray. We have lost main Ostwall outpost!"
 ukraine.64.a:0 "It's war!"
 ukraine.64.b:0 "A two front war is untimely, but necessary!"
 ukraine.64.c:0 "Well they were with Mother Russia before..."

 ukraine.68.t:0 "Ukrainian Embargo"
 ukraine.68.d:0 "The new Ukrainian nationalist government has decided to intentionally reduce our participation in their domestic markets through a series of draconian trade measures, equating in effect to a near-total embargo on our goods. This poses a major problem for our farmers because Ukraine was a big and perspective outlet for their products. Furthermore, we have traditionally been reliant on Ukrainian grain to feed our armed forces. This behaviour by Ukraine is unbelievable considering all we have done for them!"
 ukraine.68.a:0 "Demand a reversal of this outrageous embargo!"
 ukraine.68.b:0 "We can stomach this indignity."

 ukraine.69.t:0 "German Empire Demands an End to the Embargo"
 ukraine.69.d:0 "Our unexpected embargo shocked and angered the German government due to its effects on the Reich's agricultural sector and their need for our grain to serve their military. The Germans have demanded that we immediately end our protectionist trade measures or else they will begin to strip us of our Reichspakt membership. This embargo has begun to strengthen our economic self-sufficiency and power, but being thrown out of the Reichspakt suddenly may be harmful to us. What should we do?"
 ukraine.69.a:0 "Comply and remove the embargo."
 ukraine.69.b:0 "Maintain the embargo, we must protect our peasants!"

 ukraine.70.t:0 "First Results of the Embargo"
 ukraine.70.d:0 "Our decision to impose an effective embargo on German goods to help our national producers has thankfully led to a stabilisation in our agricultural sector. Perhaps 70% of the state and private farms can now be called self-supporting. As a result we can solve more difficult problems in our economy, since we have support in the villages and farms."
 ukraine.70.a:0 "The bread's back in the breadbasket of Europe!"

 ukraine.71.t:0 "Ukraine proposes an alliance!"
 ukraine.71.d:0 "Ukraine has come to us offering a military alliance, promising us access to their vast agricultural system, Black Sea ports and the undermining of Germany's the Reichspakt bloc. While it'd certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, the reaction from Germany would be unfavourable to say the least. What should we do?"
 ukraine.71.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
 ukraine.71.b:0 "We do not need this."

 ukraine.72.t:0 "Russia Accepted The Proposal!"
 ukraine.72.d:0 "Russia agreed that we should be in the same alliance, which will secure Eastern Europe both from the German imperialists and Syndicalist threat. the Reichspakt couldn't make us hate our brothers from Great Russia, which is why we decided to form this alliance - and we believe it will also be profitable for us."

 ukraine.73.t.RUS:0 "Ukraine Abandons the Reichspakt For Russia"
 ukraine.73.d.RUS:0 "An absolutely disgraceful situation has emerged on our eastern flank. Ukraine, supposedly our loyal ally and the linchpin of our Ostwall defences, has left the Reichspakt and entered an alliance with the Russians, asserting their independence from German control.

 ukraine.76.d:0 "'The White Guard' ('Belaya Gvardiya') is a film, based on the novel written by the leader of the pro-Russian movement, Mikhail Bulgakov. The film's story describes the life of one Russian family in Kiev just after the German occupation in 1918. The main characters are the Russian officers and Ukrainian citizens that participated in the defence of Kiev from those disloyal to the new regime of Ukrainian Nationalists and different socialist groups comprised of soldiers in the army of Hetman Skoropadskyi. The film analyses the relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians. Conceived by Bulgakov as a symbol of national reconciliation, 'The White Guard' encourages the unity of the Kingdom and friendship of its people, though some radical groups of the local nationalists consider this film to be Russian propaganda."
 ukraine.76.a:0 "Long live our people, united and free!"

 ukraine.77.t:0 "Rifles and carbines"
 ukraine.77.d:0 "Produced by Alexander Dovzhenko, the film 'Rifles and carbines' ('Gvintivki ta karabini') is devoted to the story of the struggle between the Russian White forces under General Drozdovskiy and the forces of the Ukrainian Kingdom in 1918 in the south during the Iassy-Don March. The film, which was conceived to be an answer to the Bulgakov's 'White Guard' doesn't try to point out possible methods of reconciliation, but raises by implication the potential for separatists and spies of foreign powers to still be hiding among the Ukrainian population and both willing and able to try to exploit its weakness."
 ukraine.77.a:0 "Death to the enemies of Ukraine!"

 ukraine.78.t:0 "The Coronation"
 ukraine.78.d:0 "Due to the nature of Vasyl's death, his successor was unable to have a proper coronation. That was, until today when [ROOT.GetLeader] was crowned King of all the Ukrainians by Metropolitan Mykola Boretsky in the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Today is a great day for all Ukrainians as we finally rid ourselves of the legacy of the old Kingdom."
 ukraine.78.a:0 "What an exciting event!"

 ukraine.79.d:0 "With our recent crackdown against the terrorist organisation 'Faith and Nation' better known as ViN in full swing, our loyal police officers have raided a suspected ViN safehouse and arrested the organisation's leader, Mikhail Bulgakov.

 ukraine.81.d:0 "Following the chaos after Vasyl's untimely death, Mikhail Bulgakov and ViN have managed to stage a bloodless coup, having already more or less controlled all organs of state and most of the regional oblasts. In his first address to the ViN stacked Rada he declared his first and perhaps, only course of action, would be to seek an immediate and indefinite reunion with Russia to be met with thunderous applause. However, in a private discussion with the cabinet he admitted that there was a possibility Ukraine may remain autonomous but Russian-aligned."

 ukraine.82.d:0 "In a shocking twist of events, following the chaos of Vasyl's death, a battalion of OUN fanatics have stormed the Rada and removed the incumbent government via force. In a national radio address, Dmytro Dontsov proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian National Republic and has declared that he will embark on a course of ultra-nationalism and creating an 'authentic Ukraine.'"

 ukraine.85.t:0 "Return To Russia?"
 ukraine.85.d:0 "It is no secret that ViN and Bulgakov are Russophiles and wish to see Ukraine, the Little Rus as they call it, reunited with the Motherland. Of course this is risky in nature.

Instead of full reintegration we could instead seek to align ourselves and seek reintegration in the distant future."

 UKR_Syn_Rev_desc:0 "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Oleksander Shumsky and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
 UKR_Friendship_Nations:0 "Friendship of Nations"
 UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc:0 "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Shumsky is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of friendship with people from all nations. That's how the people of Ukraine will cooperate for a better future!"
 UKR_Aid_Workers:0 "Liberate Industries To The Workers"
 UKR_Aid_Workers_desc:0 "The workers have Ukraine have always received a raw deal under the tyrannical Kingdom. But now with Oleksander Shumsky heading up a new popular socialist government he can begin implementing one of his more ambitious ideas of liberating industries to the workers that toil in them."
 UKR_Cheap_Housing:0 "Communal Housing"
 UKR_Cheap_Housing_desc:0 "Our engineers have designed a new type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed, at the request of our leader Oleksander Shumsky. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
 UKR_Remove_Shumsky:0 "Purge the Leftists"
 UKR_Remove_Shumsky_desc:0 "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Shumsky and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

 UKR_Broad_Coalition:0 "Coalition With The Nationalists"
 UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc:0 "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadskyi decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadskyi's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
 UKR_Rightist_Government:0 "Implement Administrative Reforms"
 UKR_Rightist_Government_desc:0 "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are under way."
 UKR_ViN_Russophiles:0 "ViN's Land Reform"
 UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc:0 "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
 UKR_OUN_Nationalists:0 "Requisition Polish Farms"
 UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc:0 "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants. This should also coincidentally appeal to nationalist supporters of both stripes that generally detest the Polish minority."
 UKR_Abolish_Law:0 "Recognise Russian"
 UKR_Abolish_Law_desc:0 "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
 UKR_Prosvita_Mov:0 "Support The Prosvita Movement"
 UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
 UKR_Free_Trade:0 "Establish The Eastern Free Trade Area"
 UKR_Free_Trade_desc:0 "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian cooperation!"
 UKR_Resettlement:0 "Resettle The Peasants"
 UKR_Resettlement_desc:0 "The Ukrainian nation is still divided, even though Ukraine itself has been an independent country for almost 20 years. We should address this situation by resettling peasants from Western Ukraine to the East, where they will become workers in the Donbass industrial region. This also will also serve to bring Ukrainian ideas and traditions into this unfriendly 'ViN' region."
 UKR_Crisis_Coalition:0 "The Coalition Splits!"
 UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc:0 "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

 UKR_Dissolve_Rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
 UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc:0 "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadskyi's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadskyi the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."
 UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy:0 "Promote Ukrainian Unity"
 UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc:0 "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
 UKR_Army_Reforms:0 "A Professional Army"
 UKR_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadskyi has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
 UKR_Peasant_State:0 "A Peasant State"
 UKR_Peasant_State_desc:0 "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
 UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism:0 "Prohibit Syndicalism"
 UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc:0 "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Syndicalists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
 UKR_Federalisation:0 "Federalisation"
 UKR_Federalisation_desc:0 "The Syndicalists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."

 UKR_New_Heir:0 "The Succession Question"
 UKR_New_Heir_desc:0 "King Vasyl, as vigorous in his production of heirs as in running the country, has left the royal succession up for debate. There are only two realistic contenders, Leo Stefan Habsburg or Danylo Skoropadskyi. Neither are completely ideal but this question must be solved sooner rather than later."
 UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty:0 "The Treaty of Pereyaslav"
 UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc:0 "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany's wrath by accepting us however."
 UKR_OUN_Embargo:0 "Embargo Germany"
 UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc:0 "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
 UKR_Grand_Coronation:0 "A Grand Coronation"
 UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc:0 "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia's Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl's death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
 UKR_Ban_ViN:0 "Ban ViN"
 UKR_Ban_ViN_desc:0 "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
 UKR_Ban_OUN:0 "Ban The OUN"
 UKR_Ban_OUN_desc:0 "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the OUN, has become something of a problem in recent years. With its fervent anti-German rhetoric, they could become a dangerous enemy and the most simplest way to deal with them is ban them and crack down on their operations."
 UKR_New_Scientists:0 "New Scientists"
 UKR_New_Scientists_desc:0 "The main aim of our government has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."
 UKR_Extend_State_Powers:0 "Extend The Executive Powers"
 UKR_Extend_State_Powers_desc:0 "The executive powers have always been a bit too weak and this allowed the left-leaning Rada to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to extend them so as to create a greater and stronger Ukrainian state."
 UKR_Discredit_Democrats:0 "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
 UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc:0 "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people's republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
 UKR_State_Companies:0 "State Backed Companies"
 UKR_State_Companies_desc:0 "As the economy begins to grow again we can begin investing in state-backed companies to further our already healthy industrial output and shield the economy from any further downward trends."
 UKR_Secret_Police:0 "The Bureau Of Special Investigations"
 UKR_Secret_Police_desc:0 "With the last few years being tumultuous at best it has been decided that a new kind of police force must be established. One that will strike from the shadows and monitor those extremists in the syndicalists who would see our state crumble."

 UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery:0 "Begin The Recovery"
 UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc:0 "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
 UKR_First_Loan:0 "Request A German Loan For Electrification"
 UKR_First_Loan_desc:0 "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
 UKR_First_TaxHike:0 "New Taxes For The Electrification"
 UKR_First_TaxHike_desc:0 "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
 UKR_Electrification:0 "New Resource Development"
 UKR_Electrification_desc:0 "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
 UKR_Second_Loan:0 "Request A German Loan For Industrialisation"
 UKR_Second_Loan_desc:0 "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. But we need investment and technological support from our ally in Berlin!"
 UKR_Second_TaxHike:0 "New Taxes For The Industrialisation"
 UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc:0 "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it's time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that's why we have to raise taxes. Again."
 UKR_Kharkov_Industry:0 "Establish New Industrial Zones"
 UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc:0 "Kharkov has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkov region and finally make our industry strong!"
 UKR_Revive_Agriculture:0 "Revive The Agricultural Sector"
 UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc:0 "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt. On the contrary, we became even more dependent on German goods after Black Monday and our trade deficit widened significantly. Now with much of the country electrified we can begin renewing this area of industry."
 UKR_Donbass_Industry:0 "Rejuvenate the Industrial Sector"
 UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc:0 "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms. Our long-term aim is to develop industry in the East of Ukraine. Thanks to the Tsarist regime, we just have to re-open old factories and modernise them a little or launch the formation of a new industrial region. The Donbass is a perfect place for such an endeavour."
 UKR_Stab_econ:0 "Stabilisation"
 UKR_Stab_econ_desc:0 "Thanks to our elaborate measures, we revived our economy and mitigated the consequences of the Black Monday for Ukraine. We can hope that our economy will soon prove itself to be competitive throughout Europe."

 UKR_army_internal_structure_review:0 "The Army Internal Structure Review"
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review_desc:0 "As 1936 rolls around, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, on behalf of King Vasyl, sets out to conduct his yearly review of the Army’s Internal Structure. A personal project of the Hetman, Skoropadskyi has dedicated much of time and resources to grooming the developing Military Apparatus."
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation:0 "Doctrinal Experimentation"
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation_desc:0 "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on newly developed warfare doctrines. For such a task, he has turned to the Top Officers’ Corps, composed of high Officers of the Independence Era - Oleksandr Udovychenko, Yevhen Konovalets and Oleksandr Zahrodskyi."
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills:0 "Rapid Mobility Drills"
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills_desc:0 "High Armored Mobility is key in modern warfare. Which is why we should make sure we have an ample supply of armored mechanical vehicles that we know how to properly utilize."
 UKR_logistical_warfare:0 "Logistical Warfare"
 UKR_logistical_warfare_desc:0 "Although our largely flat terrain is usually seen as a disadvantage, there is one key upside to it. That is, the ease of logistical supply. Taking steps to ensure we can keep continuously supplying our troops is our current chief directive."
 UKR_concentrated_firepower:0 "Concentrated Firepower Training"
 UKR_concentrated_firepower_desc:0 "There’s little more effective in warring than a punishing barrage of firepower on any given target. Effectiveness of such strategies increases even further in the event of utilising specialized artillery in divisions. Which we shall do."
 UKR_shock_artillery_fire:0 "Shock Artillery Fire"
 UKR_shock_artillery_fire_desc:0 "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it. Effective campaign of such allows the enemy to show its weakness, which is why we should invest in artillery most effective in this department."
 UKR_army_research_bureau:0 "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc:0 "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics. As such, we should establish an Army department tasked with staying on top of any new developments in Doctrinal or Technological enhancements."
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery:0 "Reverse Engineer Foreign Artillery"
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire. We should take note and go forth, examining the models utilized by our faithful allies in the North. Whatever we find out, we’ll be able to combine with our own designs and models."
 UKR_deploy_new_tanks:0 "Deploy New Tank Prototypes"
 UKR_deploy_new_tanks_desc:0 "Experimentation in the Tanking Department (centralized around the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory) is something that we’ve been engaging in for almost a decade now and it seems like our efforts have started to bear fruit, spearheaded by Junior Officer Ivan Cherniakhovskyi. We should take steps to deploy our prototypes on the field."

 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg:0 "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg_desc:0 "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on experiences of the Weltkrieg. For such a task, he has turned to the High Officers’ Corps, composed of top Officers of the Former Russian Imperial Army - Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko, Oleksandr Hrekiv and Kostiantyn Prisovskyi."
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy:0 "Refurbish Odesa Military Academy"
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy_desc:0 "As one of the oldest Military Academies in the former Russian Empire, the Odesa Military Academy is a prime education source for the arts of war. Nevertheless, the Academy has never gotten proper oversight since our Independence. Time to change that."
 UKR_adopt_new_infantry_designs:0 "Adopt New Infantry Designs"
 UKR_adopt_new_infantry_designs_desc:0 "Inspired by our longform alliance with the Kaiserreich, as well as our other Northern allies, we should move forward and adopt the centralized infantry layout utilized in the greater Reichspakt region."
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology:0 "Implement Army Radio Service"
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology_desc:0 "The Army Radio Service can easily be considered one of the pillars of future warfare. Yet, the service still lacks a proper centralized structure to make its use effective. Let us implement a centralized scheme."
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school:0 "Expand the Kyiv Officer School"
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school_desc:0 "The Kyiv Officer Instruction School was established in 1918, during the first year of Hetman Skoropadskyi's rule (but before the coronation of King Vasyl) and since then has been a consistent source of newfangled officer graduates. We should take steps to expand it."
 UKR_entrenchment_and_fortification_training:0 "Entrenchment and Fortification Training"
 UKR_entrenchment_and_fortification_training_desc:0 "It is true that our nation’s borders are not particularly defendable. Which is all the more reason why we should focus on proper entrenchment and fortification courses. For one we should be able to defend our borders, no matter where the threat comes from."
 UKR_war_games:0 "War Games"
 UKR_war_games_desc:0 "To make sure we stay vigilant, it is in our interest to enact War Games on a regular basis. Expensive? Perhaps, but it certainly is a worthwhile endeavour, allowing us to properly stay alert."
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces:0 "Consolidate the Reserve Forces"
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces_desc:0 "Currently, our reserve forces are spread out across various departments as a consequence of the bureaucratic disease. We should take steps to rectify this misdirection and unify the reservists across a streamlined number of detachments."
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan:0 "Implement the 48-Hour Plan"
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan_desc:0 "Informally known as the “48-Hour Plan”, this plan exists as a contingency effort to make sure we can defend ourselves from a total onslaught in the event of a massive invasion (most likely from the East). Successful implementation would allow us to enact a total mobilisation in the nation and make sure the foreign invaders are stopped."

 UKR_aviation_board:0 "Establish the Ukrainian Aviation Board"
 UKR_aviation_board_desc:0 "The Ukrainian Aviation Department has been part of the Army Branch since the onset of its creation. It is time we established a separate overseeing board to make use of more effective planning and strategic outcomes in regards to our Air Force."
 UKR_flying_clubs:0 "Foster Flying Clubs"
 UKR_flying_clubs_desc:0 "Flying Clubs are easily one of the best investments one can make in regards to supporting one’s national Aviation Forces. A rise in utility for Military Aviation corresponds to a rise in a need for pilots. As such, we should support the creation of Aero Clubs across the various Urban centres."
 UKR_deploy_new_fighter_prototypes:0 "Deploy New Fighter Prototypes"
 UKR_deploy_new_fighter_prototypes_desc:0 "In recent years we’ve taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our northern allies (primarily Germany). Our efforts have paid off, it seems. Testing has shown a very positive result. As such, we should deploy our newly developed aviation for mass production."
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs:0 "Commission Domestic Bomber Designs"
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs_desc:0 "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilized by our northern allies (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn’t completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."

### Naval Focuses ###
 UKR_naval_effort:0 "Review The Navy"
 UKR_naval_effort_desc:0 "A strong fleet is vital if we are to look beyond simply our own borders. Protecting our trade and coastlines shall require a strong naval force."
 UKR_Odessa_Naval:0 "Fortify The Odessa Harbour"
 UKR_Odessa_Naval_desc:0 "Odessa was always an important trade port for Ukraine, that's why we must be ready to defend this city with our Black Sea fleet. We should expand the harbour in Odessa."
 UKR_Crimea_Naval:0 "Refurbish The Port of Sevastopol"
 UKR_Crimea_Naval_desc:0 "When we took control over Crimea in 1918, we also got almost the whole Russian Black Sea fleet. Despite that boon, without a proper renovation of the Sevastopol naval base, we will be unable to use it properly. If we want to strengthen our role in the Black Sea region, we must do our best to rebuild the port of Sevastopol."
 UKR_flexible_navy:0 "The Two Seas Fleet"
 UKR_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Ukraine spans across two seas, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Differing conditions in both of these mean that a diverse, flexible navy should serve us the best."
 UKR_large_navy:0 "Naval Power Projection"
 UKR_large_navy_desc:0 "Only a large fleet will suit Ukraine, as without one we won't be able to control the long coastlines of the Black and Azov Seas."
 UKR_submarine_effort:0 "Wolves of the Euxine"
 UKR_submarine_effort_desc:0 "The submarine is vital to winning any war against a foe reliant upon trade. If their convoys are sunk, their men go without supplies - this will lead to an easy victory. We must ensure that the Black Sea acts for our enemies as little more than a dark watery grave."
 UKR_cruiser_effort:0 "Each Ship A Bulwark"
 UKR_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Native dockyards in Odessa and Nikolayev are more than capable of producing large ships, such as cruisers. These will prove priceless in nearly every naval engagement."
 UKR_destroyer_effort:0 "Convoy Defenders"
 UKR_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Our country may be able to support its people in manners of food, but other essential resources must be shipped in from the rest of the world. Destroyers will ensure that this supply is protected."
